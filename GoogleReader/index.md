#Google Reader Flatfiles

Python script to render the .json files provided by Google Takeout to flat HTML. This is about 8 years of my Google Reader usage. A huge number of old links are dead now. Lots of busted images, lots of anachronistic commentary. But, it's a lovely little peak into the past. 

This code is ugly. It is the product of many hours of googling, stackoverflow perusing and banging my head against the brick wall of json, python and far too much forgotten HTML and CSS. It is a hack. 

There are remnants from bits I abandoned, and lots of leftover variables from when I was spelunking the data. It's not optimized, _at all_. There's presentation and logic intermingled. Lots of horrible assumptions and poor flow control.  This isn't a teaching exercise, and it's not "production" type code. It's a hack. 

And it was fun.
