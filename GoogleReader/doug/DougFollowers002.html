<p><a href="http://blog.wired.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/26/jimkermitfull.jpg"><img title="Jimkermitfull" style="FLOAT:right;MARGIN:0px 0px 5px 5px" height="270" alt="Jimkermitfull" src="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/images/2008/08/26/jimkermitfull.jpg" width="270" border="0"></a> I grew up with <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Jim_Henson">Jim Henson</a>. I never met him, but I watched so many episodes of <em>Sesame Street</em> I couldn't possibly count them, and saw every episode of <em>The Muppet Show</em> when I was a bit older. Over the years I read a lot about him, enjoyed the Muppet movies, saw and loved <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Dark_Crystal"><em>The Dark Crystal</em></a> and <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Labyrinth"><em>Labyrinth</em></a>, and so was among the millions who were devastated when he suddenly died in 1990.&#160; I introduced my kids to <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Show"><em>The Muppet Show</em></a> last year, and was thrilled when they fell as much in love with it as I had.</p>
<p>I read last year about <a href="http://www.sites.si.edu/henson/index.html"><em>Jim Henson's Fantastic World</em></a>, a traveling <a title="Smithsonian Institution" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution" rel="wikipedia">Smithsonian Institution</a> exhibit dedicated not only to Henson&#39;s career but also to the imaginative process he took to come up with his innovative ideas and the way he matured those ideas into such amazing results.&#160; When it came to the Smithsonian itself in Washington, D.C., I made plans to go with my family.&#160; We went this past weekend, and it was, as advertised, fantastic.</p>
<p>The exhibit includes quite a few Muppets, including Ernie and Bert, Rowlf, and, of course, Kermit.&#160; There were puppets from some of the pre-Muppet commercials Henson made, which were shown on a looped movie in the exhibit, and, truthfully, except for pushing a product they are the equal of many <em>Muppet Show </em>sketches.&#160; There were representatives from some of his later works, including several <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Fraggle_Rock">Fraggles</a> and creatures from <em>The Dark Crystal</em>.&#160; For me, though, the highlight of the show was the arrays of hand-drawn cartoons, mostly done by Henson himself, around the walls of the exhibit.&#160; The cartoons showed his thought processes, how he built characters and then built stories around them.&#160; You could see his handwritten notes for the other Muppeteers or for what became the <a href="http://www.creatureshop.com/">Creature Shop</a>.&#160; They had a page of drawings showing the evolution of the original idea for Animal from a rough sketch to something very close to the Muppet we know and love.&#160; I really want to go back before it leaves D.C., because with the kids going back and forth from place to place I didn&#39;t get as much time to look at the drawings as I would have liked.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.wired.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/26/nuttybirdfull.jpg"><img title="Nuttybirdfull" style="FLOAT:left;MARGIN:0px 5px 5px 0px" height="260" alt="Nuttybirdfull" src="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/images/2008/08/26/nuttybirdfull.jpg" width="270" border="0"></a> The exhibit has an excellent resource room, with books for (mostly) adults to look through of information about Henson's life and work, and lots of stuff for kids: A wall where they could create their own Muppet-like faces; a table where they could draw their own storyboards; and, most popular of all, a puppet theater with a (heavily protected) video camera in front of it, so the kids can see what it's like to be a performer and a director, and they even send the video feed to the other side of the room so the kids really feel like they're on TV.</p>
<p>Really, there were only two things I disliked about the exhibit: That they prohibit photography in it, which I suspect is mostly to prevent the light from flashes from harming the Muppets and the paper; and that the exhibit shop was devoted almost entirely to <em>Sesame Street</em> merchandise.</p>
<p><em>Jim Henson's Fantastic World</em> <a href="http://www.sites.si.edu/henson/travelingExhibition.htm">leaves D.C.</a> on October 5, and heads to Atlanta.&#160; In 2009 and 2010 it will go on to visit Orlando, Seattle (at the Science Fiction Museum), Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Massachusetts, Fresno, and finally Chicago.&#160; If it&#39;s going to be near enough to you that you can get to it, I highly recommend you go.&#160; Until you get a chance to, there is an excellent <a href="http://www.sites.si.edu/henson/podcast.html">podcast</a> you can listen to that will whet your appetite.</p>
<p>(This isn&#39;t directly related to the exhibit, but it goes to show just what kind of effect Henson had on people: There are two videos after the jump, from the 1990 memorial service for Jim Henson, in which at his direction nobody wore black and there was plenty of music.&#160; I defy anyone who enjoys the Muppets to watch these videos and not get just a bit choked up.)</p>

When the police shut down the PA on Rage Against the Machine at an anti-RNC concert, the band took to the turf with a megaphone and performed a capella, delivering inspiring commentary between songs. This is must-see youtube -- some of the most heartening protest footage I've seen in years.

<p>The more I watch Microsoft&#8217;s new ad for Windows, the more I like it. </p>
<p>The ad, which debuted on Thursday night, successfully counters the idea promoted by Apple that PCs are bumbling buffoons personified by prematurely middle-aged businessmen. </p>
<p>Instead, the ad convincingly portrays the PC as part of global culture, unpretentious and down-to-earth. </p>
<p>The ad starts with a John Hodgman-alike Microsoft engineer, who proudly declares: &#8220;I&#8217;m a PC, and I am not alone.&#8221; It then swings through Europe, Africa, America and back again, showing people of all nations declaring simply one after the other: &#8220;I&#8217;m a PC.&#8221; </p>
<p>It ends with author Deepak Chopra, who says: &#8220;We are all a PC, inseparably one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watch it carefully. The people and locations of the ad clearly reflect Bill Gates&#8217; concerns about the world: disease, poverty, education and opportunity. Bill Gates makes a appearance (a welcome one. I admire him giving away his money), and there&#8217;s quite a few people from developing countries in this ad: something I&#8217;ve never seen in Apple&#8217;s marketing. </p>
<p>They&#8217;re real people, with accents and bad teeth (like me). I find it a refreshing antidote to the fake youthfulness of Apple&#8217;s iPod silhouettes and the insufferable, elitist hipster who personifies the Mac on TV. </p>
<p>I like Microsoft&#8217;s new ad because it portrays the PC through the very ordinary people that use these machines every day. It&#8217;s the opposite of Apple&#8217;s phony lifestyle advertising. It&#8217;s refreshingly egalitarian. It&#8217;s like &#8220;The Wire&#8221; versus &#8220;Law and Order.&#8221; Plus, there&#8217;s no sign of Jerry Seinfeld.</p>

<p>Whenever I find myself in a creative funk, I have a list of web sites that I can visit that instantly give me a shot of inspiration. I try to visit most of them everyday, and have found that merely studying these great sites on a consistent basis has expanded my <em>own</em> capacity for being creative. Opening up to other&#8217;s creative work is a great way to broaden our horizons and helps us think outside the box.</p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.springwise.com/" title="SpringWise">SpringWise</a></strong> - A database of great ideas that any entrepreneur can act on to help you start the &#8220;next big thing&#8221;. There are some great, fun ideas, plus they showcase the latest trends of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.whynot.net/" title="WhyNot?">WhyNot?</a></strong> - Much like SpringWise, WhyNot? has lots of user-submitted ideas for any ambitious soul to take under their wing and develop. However, WhyNot? is more of a community for entrepreneurs than SpringWise, which can be a bit more helpful at times.<br>
<a href="http://digg.com/" title="Digg"><br>
</a><strong>3. </strong><a href="http://digg.com/" title="Digg"><strong>Digg</strong></a> - You can find a smattering of news, tips and other odd things on the Digg homepage. Digg&#8217;s users find the best of the web, and the community voting does a wonderful job of showcasing quality news and compelling links. You know it&#8217;s a good site when LifeDev has been on the homepage a few times ;)<br>
<a href="http://del.icio.us/popular" title="Del.icio.us Popular"><br>
</a><strong>4. </strong><a href="http://del.icio.us/popular" title="Del.icio.us Popular"><strong>Del.icio.us Popular</strong></a> - I love the del.icio.us popular page. One can find the most creative and interesting articles and tools on the Internet on the Del.icio.us popular page. It&#8217;s basically a barometer of what&#8217;s hot on the web with designers and techies alike.<br>
<strong><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/" title="Tumblr"><br>
</a>5. <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/" title="Tumblr">Tumblr</a></strong> - Tumblr is another one of my personal favorites. Aside from creating your own Tumblelog, the Tumblr homepage showcases the best links, images and videos that people are sharing around the web.<br>
<strong><a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html"><br>
</a>6. <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html">Nasa&#8217;s Astronomy Picture of the Day</a></strong> - Have a breathtaking shot of the cosmos, once a day. Nothing is more inspiring and mysterious than outer space, in my humble opinion. Perfect for shaking any sort of doldrums you might be in.<br>
<strong><a href="http://flickrleech.net/" title="FlickrLeech"><br>
</a>7. <a href="http://flickrleech.net/" title="FlickrLeech">FlickrLeech</a></strong> - If you&#8217;re a visual person and love to view creative photos, check out FlickrLeech. You can browse just about any type of photo, plus the default view of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/" title="Flickr Interesting">Flickr Interesting</a> page is very handy, especially if you need some creative wallpapers for your desktop.<br>
<strong><a href="http://liferemix.net/" title="LifeRemix"><br>
</a>8. <a href="http://liferemix.net/" title="LifeRemix">LifeRemix</a></strong> - Shameless plug? Maybe. But I visit the site every day and am almost always inspired by the quality of writing. <em>Note: Yes, I&#8217;m the co-founder of LifeRemix ;)</em><br>

<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" title="Seth Godin&#39;s blog"><br>
</a><strong>11. </strong><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" title="Seth Godin&#39;s blog"><strong>Seth Godin&#8217;s blog</strong></a> - Aside from his uber-savvy marketing advice, there are plenty of untapped ideas and inspiration that he shares frequently with his readership.

Many ideas I&#8217;ve had for web apps come directly from concepts introduced through TechCrunch. <span style="font-style:italic">Here&#8217;s a tip: If you&#8217;re wanting to create the next big web phenomena, hang on to their every word.</span><br>

</a><strong>13. </strong><a href="http://kottke.org/" title="Kottke.org"><strong>Kottke.org</strong></a> - Jason Kottke has been posting interesting and creative information on the web for the <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/03/kottkeorg-is-ten-years-old-today" title="past 10 years">past 10 years</a>. He&#8217;s a favorite of many bloggers, and rightly so.<br>
<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/" title="BoingBoing"><br>
</a><strong>14. </strong><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/" title="BoingBoing"><strong>BoingBoing</strong></a> - One of the most popular blogs around, BoingBoing showcases the most &#8220;wonderful things&#8221; on the web. Like Kottke, BoingBoing does the dirty work of sifting through the web for the creme de la creme.<br>
<a href="http://google.com/docs" title="Google Docs"><br>
</a><strong>15. </strong><a href="http://google.com/docs" title="Google Docs"><strong>Google Docs</strong></a> - While not expressly a site for finding information, GDocs is a great tool for capturing ideas and thoughts. GDocs gives the perfect flexibility for saving quick ideas and then expounding on them later.<br>
<a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/" title="How to Change the World"><br>
</a><strong>16. </strong><a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/" title="How to Change the World"><strong>How to Change the World</strong></a> - Guy Kawaski is a fun guy with great ideas. Though his blog is geared slightly more to the marketing crowd, it&#8217;s chock-full of great ideas. I think the most stimulating thing about Guy&#8217;s blog is that it&#8217;s written with great voice and lots of humor.<br>
<a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/" title="MindMeister"><br>
</a><strong>17. </strong><a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/" title="MindMeister"><strong>MindMeister</strong></a> - Although I&#8217;m personally not a huge fan of online apps for creativity&#8217;s sake (other than GDocs), many people <strong>do </strong>like to use online mind-mapping tools for brainstorming. MindMeister is right up there with the best of the online mind-mapping tools because it&#8217;s quick and intuitive.<br>
<a href="http://twitter.com/" title="Twitter"><br>
</a><strong>18. <a href="http://twitter.com/" title="Twitter">Twitter</a></strong> - Although the way I use twitter is more as a web service, (I use the <a href="http://www.twhirl.org/" title="twhirl">twhirl</a> twitter client), Twitter can use your friends to help you find interesting and creative articles to check out. You can quickly ask your friends if anyone has an idea for XYZ, and odds are someone can point you in the right direction. Also, your friends will most likely link to content that you&#8217;ll find interesting as well.<br>
<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" title="Smashing Magazine"><br>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'>Seth Godin has posted a transcript of a fantastic talk he gave to some music execs about the future of the music industry and the Internet. This is some good straight-shooting insight about what the music industry will never succeed at (suing fans) and what they could do instead (courting fans):

<blockquote>
<img src="http://craphound.com/images/godinmusic.jpg"><br>
So if I put all this together I&#8217;m going to come up with what I call the Merchant Solution. It has nothing to do with stores, it has to do with Natalie Merchant. (laughter) So, Natalie Merchant shows up in the New York Times last week saying not only do I not have a record label, I&#8217;m not going to make records anymore because I just figure out how to do it. And that is the biggest opportunity times 10,000 because Natalie doesn&#8217;t want to be in business, Natalie wants to make records. Thirty years ago Natalie couldn&#8217;t put together the scratch to record an album because she couldn&#8217;t afford a recording studio. Thats what you guys did for her. She couldn&#8217;t come up with the time and energy to go out to California to sell and pay for shelf space at Tower, thats what you guys did for her. The point is, now she needs somebody to say &#8220;let us take care of your tribe&#8221;. Let us figure out the business model that says you get to do what you&#8217;re great at, write songs, perform them, find people who love you, not like you, and they are A LOT in the case of Natalie Merchant, and we will figure out not how to exploit that, not how to write a contract that you&#8217;re going to regret for the rest of your life, but to sit next to you and say guess what, there are all these people in the tribe [and] we need to figure out how to make stuff for them. And, because we have three other artists that are just like you, Cowboy Junkies, we can start mixing tribes together in appropriate ways that makes everybody happy. Because you [record label] could go to the Cowboy Junkies tribe and say Natalie Merchant is coming to town and they&#8217;ll all go. Because they love her and they love each other and they want to see each other again because they can&#8217;t wait a whole year till the [Cowboy] Junkies come back.
<p>
So if the model that we loved about the record business in 1968 was A&amp;R, taking care of artists, finding artists who people will love, and the model that we hated was brand management, I want to argue that the next model is tribal management. That the next model is to say, what you do for a living is manage a tribe...many tribes...silos of tribes. That your job is to make the people in that tribe delighted to know each other and trust you to go find music for them. And, in exchange, it could be way out on the long tail, no one wants to be on the long tail by themselves, the polka lovers like the polka lovers, they want to be together. But that you, maybe it is only one person, technology makes this really easy, your job is to curate for that tribe, like the curators upstairs [at the museum]. There is a museum of modern art tribe, you can see them here every Thursday. And if you can curate for them guess what the [musical] artists need...you! Guess what the tribe needs...you! You add an enormous amount of value by becoming a new kind of middleman.

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p><img src="http://lifedev.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/reclaim-childhood-creativity1.jpg" alt="reclaim childhood creativity" align="right"></p>
<p>Growing up, I didn&#8217;t play with a whole lot of store-bought toys. It&#8217;s not that my parents didn&#8217;t provide enough tools to stimulate my young mind. In fact, it was quite the opposite: my parents had given me the best toy a young boy could have. I was raised in the country.</p>
<p>Living in the middle of nowhere for the first part of my childhood meant that I didn&#8217;t need very many toys to keep me happy. Instead I preferred activities&#195;&#8218;&#194;&#160; like climbing trees, turning hay bales into forts and tromping through the woods, to name a few. I learned quickly that the best fun was the kind made with your own imagination.</p>
<p><strong>When did we outgrow &#8220;imagination&#8221;?<br>
</strong><br>
How many times as children did we take mundane materials like sheets and couch coushions to create castles and forts? I distinctly remember using a toilet plunger as a sword many a time in the early years. (What?! It seemed like a good idea at the time&#8230;) For some reason as adults we &#8220;grow&#8221; out of this creative mindset and started worrying about the everyday bits of life. While this is important for functioning in society,it sure puts a damper on being creative.</p>
<p>Kids are some of the best problem solvers around. Give a kid motivation for solving a problem, and they&#8217;ll use whatever resources handy to get it done. Not only that, they won&#8217;t quit until they&#8217;ve found the solution. They have the perfect blend of determination, creativity and downright recklessness to find a solution.</p>
<p>So where did adults go wrong? I&#8217;d argue that we stopped listening to the inner child and started listening to our bosses or worse, our insecurities. Now we see the world through jaded eyes, and what was once wonderful is now commonplace.But it doesn&#8217;t have to be like that. Here are a few ways to recapture that mindset of a creative child:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Eliminate pesky technology distractions</span>. How many small children do you know that check their email constantly? Or are constantly on the phone? Yeah, me either.<span style="font-weight:bold"></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Stop multi-tasking</span>. Kids have a one-track mind. Unlike the awful training that they&#8217;ll receive when they&#8217;re older, at a young age they have the incredible ability to not only focus on the task at hand, but to <em>fixate </em>on it.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Seek alone time</span>. It never ceases to amaze me how productive kids are when they&#8217;re playing by themselves. They are literally the masters of getting into the <a href="http://lifedev.net/2006/11/produce-more-by-getting-into-the-flow/" title="working flow">flow</a>.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Be silly</span>. I&#8217;m not joking. While this is what kids are notorious for, it can actually be an incredible tactic to really think outside the box. How many major breakthroughs and products were developed around some guy having a lazy beer with another friend posing unlikely &#8220;what if&#8221; scenarios. For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard" title="example">exa</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_computer" title="example">mple</a>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Bill Hewlett</em>: (Chuckling) &#8220;Hey Dave, what if someone made a computer that was smaller than a room, and people could use them in their homes?! Oh man, that would be crazy rad.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px"><em>David Packard</em>: &#8220;Hrm&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Being silly allows you to explore those scenarios that you wouldn&#8217;t bother with if you were thinking like a responsible adult.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Nap times</span>. Unfortunately, as we&#8217;ve gotten older we tend to overlook the fact that growing up, we had nap times at the <span style="font-style:italic">same time every day</span>. While we may not need a daily afternoon siesta, the principle still remains: make sure rest is a priority. Rest is essential for creativity, and without it we don&#8217;t leave enough resources to think outside the box. We&#8217;re more interested in getting through the day.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Milk and cookies.</span> Ahh yes&#8230; who doesn&#8217;t love milk and cookies? Milk and cookies stand for the simple pleasures that we overlook every day because we&#8217;re too busy. Simple treats in our day can make a huge difference in our overall attitude and boost our mood. Have you ever had a splurge of creativity while being depressed? It&#8217;s hard to be creative while grumpy. Have a cookie.</li>
<li><strong>Test the boundaries.<em> </em></strong>Anyone who&#8217;s spent more than 5 minutes with a 2-year old knows what this means. Kids will always, <em>always</em> try to push the limits. While this can be pretty frustrating as a parent, it can be a good thing as a child. Without testing boudaries, the child doesn&#8217;t learn what it can&#8217;t do, or more importantly, what it <em>can </em>do. As adults, we can easily become complacent. But true innovation means that we have to be willing to take risks and test the boundaries. Tim Ferriss <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/" title="four hour work week">puts it best</a> by saying we should implement first and apologize later (only if it blows up).</li>
<li><strong>See the world with wonder. </strong>Einstein was famous for this. Because his language developed slowly as a lad, it allowed him to look in wonder at the common things most people don&#8217;t take a second look at. &#8220;The ordinary adult never bothers his head about the problems of space and time. These are things he has thought of as a child.. Consequently, I probed more deeply into the problem than an ordinary child would have.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1607298-1,00.html" title="source">source</a> ) Einstein&#8217;s ability to see the world with a child&#8217;s eyes gave him a unique insight on everyday findings, which eventually led to some of the world&#8217;s most amazing breakthroughs in science.</li>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><a href="http://www.kk.org">Kevin Kelly</a> has been blogging about new business models for artists who work at &quot;the low end of the long tail,&quot; and exploring how one might  make a living in a micro-niche. He proposed the idea of artists directly cultivating &quot;1000 True Fans&quot;  in a previous post, and follows up with real numbers from artists who have a reputation for thriving on a dedicated fan base...

<blockquote><a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/04/the_reality_of.php"><img src="http://www.boingboing.net/images/x_2008/robertrich08.jpg" width="272">
</a><br><p>One of the artists I contacted was musician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rich_%28musician%29">Robert Rich</a> (above), whom I knew only as a fan (but not a True Fan). Rich was an early pioneer in ambient music, and a force in the Bay Area new age music scene in the early 1980s. He&#39;s prolific, issuing about 40 albums in the past 20 years, many in collaboration with other ambient musicians. Among his earliest albums was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B0006IB7KS%26tag=kkorg-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B0006IB7KS%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">&quot;Numena&quot;</a>, which made his reputation, and among his latest is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000VKL0VW%26tag=kkorg-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000VKL0VW%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">&quot;Eleven Questions&quot;</a>, which was recorded with colleagues in a seven day burst at his home studio.<p>
Robert Rich was one of the first professional musicians to start dealing directly with his fans via <a href="http://robertrich.com/index.html">his own website</a>, which is why I contacted him. He wrote an extremely candid, insightful and thorough reply to my query. He tempers my enthusiasm for 1000 True Fans with a cautionary realism borne from actually trying the idea. The summary of his experience is so pertinent and detailed that I felt was worth posting in full. With his permission, it follows, slightly edited.
<p>
<em>I agree strongly with your basic thesis [of a thousand True Fans], that artists can survive on the cusp of the long tail by nurturing the help of dedicated fans; but perhaps I can modulate your welcome optimism with a light dose of realism, tempered by some personal reflections. </em></p></p></p></blockquote>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'>People of all religious denominations will be overjoyed to learn that a statue of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was installed on the Cumberland County Courthouse Lawn in Crossville, Tennessee today.

<p>Statement at Installation Ceremony
<br>March 21, 2008

</p><p>We are lucky enough to live in a country that allows us, its citizens, the freedom of speech. I have chosen to put up a statue of the Flying Spaghetti Monster to represent the discourse between people of all different beliefs. The many faiths, ethnicities and backgrounds of Cumberland County&#8217;s residents make our community a stronger richer place. I respect and am proud that on the people&#8217;s lawn, the county courthouse, all of these diverse beliefs can come together in a positive dialogue. Here, we are all able to share the issues close to our hearts whether it is through a memorial to the soldiers killed fighting for our country, the Statue of Liberty honoring our nations welcoming promise to all, a group&#8217;s fight to stop homelessness, or powerful symbols of faith. I greatly treasure this open forum between everyone in the community.

</p><p>The Flying Spaghetti Monster is a pile of noodles and meatballs, but it is meant to open up discussion and provoke thought. Being able to put up a statue is a celebration of our freedom as Americans; a freedom to be different, to express those differences, and to do it amongst neighbors -&#8212; even if it is in a noodley way.

<p>
"Going For an English" is a classic sketch from the British variety show "Goodness Gracious Me," in which an Indian family goes out "for an English" after drinking too much, patronizing the waiter and demanding the blandest thing on the menu. It's some goddamned funny stuff.

That may not sound like an amazing feat, unless you've tried to keep a page open in mobile Safari and have it <em>not</em> try to refresh and fail when you're not connected. The app uses a JavaScript bookmarklet&#8212;which, at this point, you have to manually tweak a bit&#8212;and the Instapaper web service to provide you with your reading. The one drawback (or possible benefit) is that pages are knocked down to a text-only, mobile-friendly view. Other than that, it's a good way to ensure you can do some web reading on a plane or wherever you lack service. Instapaper Free is a free download for iPhones and iPod touch models running the 2.0 upgrade; the "Pro" version uncaps the 10-article limit. </p><div><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284942713&amp;mt=8">Instapaper Free</a> [iTunes App Store via <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/09/22/instapaper-iphone-app/">Download Squad</a>]</div> <br style="clear:both">
