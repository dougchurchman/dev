<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><img alt="pc%20resolutions.png" src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2007/01/pc%20resolutions.png" width="480" height="209"><p><i>by Adam Pash</i></p><p>At the start of every new year, people the world over make resolutions to better themselves, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/new-years-resolutions/reader-poll--whats-your-top-resolution-for-2007-225083.php">with fitness, health, money, and career goals</a> at the forefront of our minds.  But what about your poor, neglected PC?  Couldn't it use, at the very least, a few resolutions toward better health and fitness?</p><p>Today, I've compiled a list of 7 PC resolutions - those nagging PC activities you should engage in more often but don't - to help you and your computer start off the new year on the right foot.  From defragging and backing up your hard drive to organizing your documents, this is a roundup of best practices and automation tools straight from the Lifehacker vault.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The following PC resolutions apply to both Windows PCs and Macs (except for the bit on hard drive defragmentation), so when applicable I've tried to include Mac and Windows solutions.  Most of the required software is freeware, so all you need to follow any of these tips is a little bit of time and resolve.</p><p><strong>1. Regularly back up your hard drive:</strong> If there's one thing that nags most computer users in the "I-know-I-<em>should</em>-but-I-don't" way, it's hard drive back ups.  We've all been there: as long as your hard drive keeps on spinning, it's easy to ignore the whole back up thing - until the Grim Reaper comes knocking at your door in the form of the dreaded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bsod">BSoD</a>, that is.</p><img alt="back%20up.png" src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2007/01/back%20up.png" width="140" height="76"><p>Rather than fearing the reaper, just find yourself a cheap external hard drive (or <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/feature/how-to-install-a-hard-drive-137179.php">install one yourself</a>) and <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/geek-to-live-automatically-back-up-your-hard-drive-147855.php">set up a simple, automated back up for your hard drive</a> using SyncBack Freeware.  For Mac users, check out <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/backup-utilities/download-of-the-day-part-ii--silverkeeper-mac-backup-156468.php">SilverKeeper</a> for simple, scheduled back ups.</p><img alt="self%20repairing%20hard%20drive.png" src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2007/01/self%20repairing%20hard%20drive.png" width="280" height="126"><p><strong>2. Set up a self-repairing hard drive:</strong> Windows only: Most Windows users have heard that they should defragment their hard drives on a semi-regular basis, but I'd venture to guess that of the users who actually know what that means, even fewer actually do it.  Why?  Because, like any other preventative measure, it can seem like a pain in the ass; nobody wants to sit around watching and waiting for their hard disk to defrag.</p><p>So, to make things easier on yourself, set up your computer to <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/hard-drives/geek-to-live--the-selfrepairing-hard-drive-172346.php">automatically check itself for and repair errors, then defragment all of your drives</a> with a simple batch script.  Then just set the batch script to run <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/feature/hack-attack-using-windows-scheduled-tasks-153089.php">using Windows Scheduled Tasks</a> and your computer will, for the most part, take care of itself.</p><p><strong>3. Clean out your hard drive:</strong> It's easy to let you hard drive get filled up with files you neither need nor use, but it can be hard to roll up your sleeves and actually clean everything up.  The messier that hard drive gets, though, the tougher it can be to find those things you actually want.</p><img alt="windirstat.png" src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2007/01/windirstat.png" width="472" height="184"><p>You could sit down and go through your folders one by one (and, to be honest, this isn't a bad way to go if you've got the right time), but if you don't have a few hours to spend pruning your drive, we've covered a few methods to <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/disk-space/geek-to-live--visualize-your-hard-drive-usage-219058.php">visualize your hard drive usage</a> on both Windows and Mac PCs.  Once you've got a good visual representation of what's what on your hard drive, it becomes much easier to get rid of files you didn't even know existed.</p><p>While you're cleaning out files, you might want to set up your <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/holidays/geek-to-live--a-meaty-thanksgiving-download-215491.php">antivirus and spyware cleaners</a> for scheduled sweeps if you haven't already (hopefully you have).  You can also clean up a little space with the aptly named <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/utilities/download-of-the-day-ccleaner-134407-windows-210959.php">CrapCleaner</a>.  Now might also be a good time to go through your installed programs and get rid of anything you don't use.</p><p><strong>4. Organize your virtual file cabinet:</strong> Having cleaned out all the unneeded waste, it's time to organize what's left.  While there are <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/file-management/ask-the-readers-file-management-195201.php">a lot of options for organizing your files</a>, Gina's <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/top/geek-to-live--organizing-my-documents-156196.php">method for organizing "My Documents"</a> is a tried-and-true winner.</p><p><strong>5. Keep your hard drive clean:</strong> So your hard drive is finally free of clutter, and you've got a new system in place to keep everything organized, but... what's to say you're ever going to stick to that?</p><img alt="hard%20drive%20janitor.png" src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2007/01/hard%20drive%20janitor.png" width="221" height="108"><p>Apart from your will power (which I'm sure is excellent), there are a couple of great automation tools that can help you keep everything in its place.  On Windows PCs, the free <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/geek-to-live-hard-drive-janitor-133190.php">Hard drive Janitor</a> script will monitor specified folders and clean out files older than a user-defined number of days.</p><p>On the Mac side of things, the incredible shareware app <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/file-management/download-of-the-day--hazel-mac-224109.php">Hazel</a> lets you monitor user-defined folders and set rules for deleting and moving files within those folders based on a very powerful filtering system (for example, you can send all MP3 files in a folder to an iTunes playlist, while deleting all .dmg files older than a week).  If you're looking for a bit of Windows shareware that works similarly to Hazel, you might want to check out <a href="http://www.desktopminds.com/cleandeskorganizer.html">Cleandesk Organizer</a>.</p><img alt="encryption hash.png" src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2007/01/encryption%20hash.png" width="111" height="92"><p><strong>6. Encrypt your private data:</strong> Whether you're keeping your secret video stash hidden from the kids or you actually have sensitive data you want to hide from the prying eyes of the world at large, now's as good of a time as any to <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/top/geek-to-live--encrypt-your-data-178005.php">encrypt your Windows data with TrueCrypt</a>.  For a freeware Mac solution, try <a href="http://www.dejal.com/classic/quickencrypt/">QuickEncrypt</a>.</p><img alt="secure passwords.png" src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2007/01/secure%20passwords.png" width="257" height="128"><p><strong>7. Securely track your passwords:</strong> While we're on the subject of privacy, there's always the matter of those pesky passwords - you know, the ones written on Post-It notes, hanging from your monitor?  First, you may need to start <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/top/geek-to-live--choose-and-remember-great-passwords-184773.php">choosing better passwords</a>.</p><p>Already got strong passwords?  Good.  Windows users can <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/feature/geek-to-live--securely-track-your-passwords-184774.php">securely track those passwords with KeePass</a>.  If you work on a PC but moonlight on a Mac, you can export and encrypt the password list from KeePass (if you want to have access to your KeePass list on a Mac).  In general, though, the Mac's built-in Keychain app handles a lot of the duties of KeePass.</p><h4>A fresh start</h4><img alt="xp pro cracked.png" src="http://www.lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2007/01/xp%20pro%20cracked.png" width="218" height="165"><p>If you'd love to follow some of these PC resolutions on your computer, but you've got that lost-cause feeling that comes from years of neglect, maybe it's time to start over from scratch.</p><p>That's right, time to <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/windows/geek-to-live-how-to-format-your-hard-drive-and-install-windows-xp-from-scratch-157578.php">format your hard drive and install Windows XP from scratch</a> (perhaps you'll want to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/partition/download-of-the-day-gparted-live-cd-175024.php">partition your drive</a> for other operating systems, while you're at it).  I actually did the quickest reinstall of Windows in my life over the weekend thanks to Gina's post on <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/downloads/geek-to-live--automatically-download-and-install-your-favorite-software-211373.php">automatically installing your favorite software with InstallPad</a> - and, of course, thanks to following several of the aforementioned resolutions in '06 (automated back up is a <em>life saver!</em>).</p><p>You may have noticed that most of our PC maintenance howto's were written by Gina, who's a model of healthy and smart PC livin'.  We'd all do well to follow in her footsteps.</p><p>If you've got your own list of PC resolutions for 2007, share them in the comments.</p><p><em><a href="http://adampash.org/">Adam Pash</a> is an associate editor for Lifehacker whose resolved to make '07 the year of hard drive perfection.

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p><img height="114" src="http://www.aeropause.com/archives/opera-wii.jpg" width="225" border="0">I spent some hands-on time with the Wii&#8217;s Opera browser last night. While it&#39;s a very basic application,&#160;having a web browser on a game console opens your&#160;living room up to a plethora of wacky flash games to enjoy. I&#8217;ve been casually playing flash games on my&#160;PSP&#160;for over a year now, so I thought I&#8217;d share some of my collected content with new web browsin&#39; Wii owners out there. </p><p>Back in May 2006, I began putting&#160;together a collection of&#160;flash games for the PSP. These games have been tested to run well on the custom-designed PSP Web Browser, which is surprisingly similar in compatibility to the Wii Opera browser. Some&#160;that were&#160;left off my original list exceeded the memory of the PSP cache but&#160;now that I&#8217;m familiar with the Wii&#8217;s capabilities, I&#8217;ll be adding those to this page in the coming days for you to enjoy. </p><p>I&#8217;ve put direct links to these games inside so when you navigate&#160;within from your Wii, you can bookmark it and just click the games to play.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be adding more to this page as they become available and are tested to work.&#160; Feel free to bookmark this page and check back often. <em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&#160;</font></em></p><p><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">- </font><a href="http://www.salesmunn.com/content/PSP%20Flash%20Games/Solitaire.swf"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Solitaire</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> &#8211; Simple solitaire game.

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>Andrew Leonard <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/int/2007/02/03/leonard/print.html">interviewing Scott Rosenberg</a>:</p><blockquote>  <p>And programmers, as I quote Larry Constantine in my book, programmers are programmers because they like to code &#8212; given a choice between learning someone else&#8217;s code and just sitting down and writing their own, they will always do the latter.</p></blockquote><p><em>cough</em></p><p>Wow. If Rosenberg isn&#8217;t butchering Constantine&#8217;s quote, it lends credence that even software&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Constantine">great practitioners</a> lack the ability to introspect and cogently report on their own profession. No wonder we&#8217;re all confused.</p><p>Rosenberg is wrong. Programmers don&#8217;t <em>like coding</em>, they <strong><em>like problem solving</em></strong>.</p><p>If programmers liked to code, we&#8217;d all be writing in machine language to this day. You can write that stuff all day and get precious little  of the real problem solved.</p><p>If programmers liked to code, they wouldn&#8217;t value a language by <a href="http://www.cpan.org">its libraries</a>. If programmers liked to code, every last one of us would be overjoyed to write our own HTTP client.</p><p>Instead, programmers get pissed when they have to write code. &#8220;I just want to update this field in this file, why do I have to write an XML parser?&#8221; They will abandon languages/platforms wholesale that lack the features they need (either built-in or as libraries).</p><p>From an outsider&#8217;s vantage, I can see why they&#8217;d think we like coding. We solve problems by coding, and we&#8217;re all happy and enthused while typing away or talking code. But they&#8217;re confusing the action and the intention. It&#8217;s not pulling the trigger that makes me happy, it&#8217;s hitting the target. The action approaches <em>incidental</em>.</p><p>Another reason outsiders think we like to code is that we&#8217;re always talking about <em>rewriting</em> things. Even coders themselves <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">fall into the delusion</a> we rewrite because it&#8217;s &#8220;more fun than reading other people&#8217;s code&#8221;.</p><p>While there are times we want to ground-up rewrite due to architectural considerations (new runtime, new language, major new functionality) in my experience the common case for wanting to rewrite <em>is to understand</em>.</p><p>Spolsky gets it right that &#8220;<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">It&#8217;s harder to read code than to write it</a>&#8221;, but unfortunately reaches for the tired &#8220;people (programmers) are stupid/lazy/undiciplined&#8221; argument as an explanation. (I chafe in principle against this class of argument since it almost always obscures deeper underlying factors.)</p><p>He grazes the desire-to-understand intent behind rewriting by trotting out the two-page function example with the hypothetical programmer&#8217;s &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what half of these API calls are for&#8221; quotation, but leaves it to die in the snow for his shinier superficial negative explanation.</p><p>Programmers desire to rewrite because they know that after starting with a clean sheet of paper and building it all again, at the end they&#8217;ll understand the whole. <em>Programmers write code to learn.</em> Software has this double-edged sword where you can&#8217;t just wave your hands instead of implementing a particular function. It all has to be crystal. Programmers know this. They know when they&#8217;re done, they&#8217;ll have a complete understanding. It&#8217;s a noble desire.</p><p>Bad source bases irritate programmers because it shakes their foundation of understanding necessary to solve the problem. I reject the explanation that programmers capriciously want to rewrite code for the fun of it.</p><p>The programmers-write-code-to-learn idea is behind Brooks&#8217; &#8220;build one to throw one away&#8221;. Brooks&#8217; idea was seminal but raw, today we&#8217;ve nuanced it down to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SpikeDescribed">spikes</a> and iterative development.</p><p>The second and final deep reason behind the desire to rewrite is elegance. Like rewrite-to-understand, this reason is also founded in understanding. Once you understand a problem and have its solution, it&#8217;s only natural to want to cleave off the unnecessary, trimming the  solution to its stark and obvious. Throwing a bone to Spolsky, I&#8217;ll concede rewriting-for-elegence is a slippery slope toward code narcissism.</p><p>Summing up: programmers don&#8217;t like to code, we like to solve problems. Coding is not problem solving, but software problem solving usually involves some coding. Even when we talk about rewriting something, the objective is not to code, it&#8217;s usually to get a better understanding of the problem for solving in the best possible manner.</p><p>A much better argument is that since programmers like problem solving, they invent problems where there aren&#8217;t any. <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The_Complicator&#39;s_Gloves.aspx">But that&#8217;s another post.</a></p><p><strong>Update Feb 5:</strong> Rosenberg responds, Walker frames Constantine&#8217;s quote and I dredge up bubble-land <a href="http://rentzsch.com/notes/programmersDontLikeToCodeFollowup">in my follow-up</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class='row'>

You can read about it here: <a href="http://flimflan.com/blog/MigrateFromFlexWikiToOneNote.aspx"><strong>Migrate from FlexWiki to OneNote</strong></a><strong>
		</strong></p><p>Here are some excerpts:
</p><p style="margin-left:36pt"><em>Then Microsoft OneNote 2007 was released, sporting a <a href="http://flimflan.com/blog/ct.ashx?id=19032ba2-8851-4f3b-b2e3-37e22ab0abc8&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2foffice.microsoft.com%2fen-us%2fonenote%2fHA100325701033.aspx">new "shared notebook" feature</a>. With OneNote, you get the same ease of access and ease of editing that a wiki provides, but with a much smoother experience. To mirror the history log functionality of a wiki, you can store your shared notebook in a versioned SharePoint&#160;document library.&#160;The only disadvantage of OneNote compared to a wiki is the requirement for all of your users to have OneNote. If that requirement is already met, I believe OneNote is a far superior experience. OneNote advantages at a glance:
</em></p><ul style="margin-left:72pt"><li><em><strong>Easier editing</strong>. Toolbar buttons and shortcut keys instead of funky markup syntax to learn. No need to switch to "edit mode". 
</em></li><li><em><strong>Richer formatting.</strong> Text can be many styles, sizes, colors. Screenshots and other images can be easily pasted inline. Documents and audio clips can be attached to a page. 
</em></li><li><em><strong>Easier searching.</strong> Searches find words in any page text, </em>image<em>, or </em>audio clip<em>! 
</em></li><li><em><strong>Offline access.</strong> All data is synchronized to your local machine when you are connected to the network, so you can access it when you are disconnected. Any edits you (or others) make are automatically synchronized to and from the shared location when you reconnect.
</em></li></ul><p><em>My team was sold on the benefits, but we had a sizable investment in our existing FlexWiki installation. Thankfully, OneNote has a nice API that makes it easy to get data in and out. I was able to put together an application that migrated our entire wiki to a OneNote notebook, with all formatting and hyperlinks intact.</em>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><h4>1. Color shortcuts and color conversions</h4>

<p>In <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">CSS</a>, you can write color values in a variety of ways, e.g. "RGB(0,0,0)", "black", and "#000000" all result in black. However, you can also use a shortcut for hexadecimal values that follows this form: "#000". #0BC for example means #00BBCC but is a little quicker to write.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you need to feed color values into forms, e.g. for tools such as Google AdSense where you can define a border and background color, you need to provide hexadecimal values only. However, as you may want to mirror an existing RGB value in your CSS file, you need a color converter. Some years ago I created desktop tool <a href="http://www.outer-court.com/basic/file/colset.zip">WebCol</a> to convert between the different CSS color formats and I'm still using it for those occasions... and there are also <a href="http://www.draac.com/colorconvert.html">online converters</a>.</p>


<h4>2. CSS bug hunting</h4>

<p>Your stylesheet doesn't seem to do what you want it to do? There's a variety of approaches you can use to debug the problem now:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Make sure your HTML validates.</strong> Validation is the basis for the actual debugging process, because if you have an open tag somewhere, the whole file may be screwed. So jump to the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> and do a quick check if every element is in place.</li>

<li><strong>Make sure you're running the CSS in compliant mode.</strong> Many browsers support two rendering modes; a backwards compliant "quirks mode" and a "standards compliance mode." For example, in Firefox you can right-click any HTML page and select "View page info" to check the render mode value. If you are having CSS problems, don't even start to tweak and debug before you've ensured you're running in the standards compliance mode (e.g. having a Strict doctype in your HTML ensures this).</li>

<li><strong>Use a deeper selector.</strong> Sometimes, the styling you want to achieve is overridden by another selector somewhere else in the CSS file you&#39;re working on (or another CSS file). A quick fix is to use a deeper selector &#8211; e.g. &quot;body div#foo .bar { ... }&quot; instead of just &quot;.bar { ... }&quot; to give your current styling more importance in the cascading.</li>

<li><strong>Confused about the box model you're currently working with?</strong> CSS can get confusing if you're working with deeply nested HTML elements. One quick visualization of what you're actually looking at is to use something like "div { border: 2px dotted red; }" to give every div element on the page a red border, and then refresh the HTML page (you want to remove the border after you found the bug, of course).</li>

<li><strong>Someone told you your page is broken on Mac Safari... but you run Windows!</strong> How do you check how well your CSS file works in different browsers, different browser versions, and different operating systems? One easy way is to use <a href="http://browserpool.de/kc/wob/portal.jsp?lang=en">BrowserPool</a>. This little free download lets you select from a variety of OS's and browser versions, and you can then upload your (trade-secret-cleansed!) HTML to your server to give it a quick check through the eyes of this "virtual PC."</li>

</ul>


<h4>3. Media separation</h4>

<p>One bonus of using external CSS files instead of inline stylesheets is that you can serve different layouts to different media &#8211; like a mobile layout vs a screen layout. So you&#39;ll be using something like...</p>

<div><pre style="background-color:#eee;border:1px solid black;overflow:scroll;width:500px">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;default.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;screen,projection,print&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;mobile.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;handheld&quot; /&gt;</pre></div>

<p>(If you don&#39;t add &quot;projection&quot; to the default media mix, Opera users who switch to full-screen mode are in for a surprise &#8211; a page deprived of layout!)</p>

<p>But whooopsie &#8211; this won&#39;t even work as intended in some mobile browsers (hint: Microsoft)! Oh well, it still makes sense to use external CSS files, because it&#39;s easier to maintain and allows for neat caching of files.</p>

<p>On a side-note, I'm always using my (old) free <a href="http://www.netpadd.com">Netpadd</a> so I don&#39;t have to manually type lines like the &quot;link&quot; stuff above (I just type &quot;&lt;link &quot; and the rest can be selected from an auto-complete box... I can then hit F9 to jump straight to the CSS file, or Ctrl+F9 to jump to the JS in a new Netpadd window). Netpadd, which basically looks like Notepad, also has CSS auto-completion, so I can type &quot;bor&quot; (for &quot;border&quot;), hit Ctrl+F5, and have a CSS reference pop up.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.outer-court.com/files/css-tips/netpadd.png" alt=""></p>


<h4>4. Center the thing</h4>

<p>You'll often want to have a "page"- or "content"-class div to center everything. One way to do so is to use "margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; position: relative". You can even use absolutely positioned layers inside this div.</p>


<h4>5. Anti-aliased PNG files</h4>

<p><img src="http://blog.outer-court.com/files/css-tips/logo.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I was in for a surprise recently when I checked the CSS code for Google's new <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">personalized homepage</a> themes... the logo was using cross-browser anti-alias for a varied background! As you probably know, anti-alias is giving rough pixel lines a softer border by blending in some pixels with the background. However, with GIF files this only worked on a background of a static color, because you have to decide beforehand into which color you want to blend those pixels. In theory, PNG files do support varied levels of transparency; however, an Internet Explorer 6 bug prevents this from working cross-browser (and when it doesn't work, we call it "<a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-01-28-n10.html">ghosting</a>&quot; &#8211; take a very close look at some of the <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/home">Picasa Web Albums</a> buttons and you'll spot it).</p>

<p>But back to Google &#8211; here&#39;s what I saw in their CSS (slightly reformatted for readability):</p>

<div><pre style="background-color:#eee;border:1px solid black;overflow:scroll;width:500px">#regular_logo
{
    background:url(&#39;test.png&#39;); width:150px; height:55px;
}
/* \ */
* html #regular_logo
{
    background:none;
    float:left;
    width:150px;
    filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src=&#39;test.png&#39;, sizingMethod=&#39;scale&#39;);
}
/* */</pre></div>

<p>So instead of outputting the image in the HTML, they use a (semantically slightly incorrect) empty div which then receives a background PNG file. That PNG file includes varied transparency (it softly blends into the background, including some shadow effect). Now in the CSS they use two selectors, a "normal" one and one that is shielded by some hack that serves some browsers only. And you can see there's a line starting with "filter:progid" which does the magic of fixing the IE6 PNG bug.</p>


<h4>6. Quick 'n' dirty rounded box corners</h4>

<p>If you want to have a very quick way to give something rounded corners, and you don&#39;t really care if the effect is lost on some browsers, you can use a definition like the following: &quot;-moz-border-radius: 8px&quot;. It&#39;s a Firefox thing that&#39;s playing around with CSS3, but it only takes a couple of seconds to write, and if the effect is not important to the overall layout &#8211; and you don&#39;t mind that the borders aren&#39;t anti-aliased &#8211; I think it&#39;s better than nothing (for example, I use it at the &quot;Game Over&quot; dialog of <a href="http://www.gamesforthebrain.com/game/colorlines/">this game</a>, where I don't consider the rounded borders crucial in any way).</p>


<h4>7. Opacity</h4>

<p>To make a div layer (or mostly anything else) blend in with the background, you can use the following property-value pairs:</p>

<div><pre style="background-color:#eee;border:1px solid black;overflow:scroll;width:500px">-moz-opacity: .5;
filter: alpha(opacity=50);</pre></div>

<p>The first is for Firefox, the second for Internet Explorer. This effect can also create neat shadows &#8211; just use an empty shadow layer (that is, a div of the class &quot;shadow&quot;), give it a slight offset, a black background, and put it behind another box.</p>

<p>PS: You want to access a "moz" value in JavaScript? Use something like this (note the upper-case "m" and "o"):</p>

<div><pre style="background-color:#eee;border:1px solid black;overflow:scroll;width:500px">var elm = document.getElementById("myElm");
myElm.style.MozOpacity = .5;
</pre></div>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> You can drop the "-moz-" prefix in all modern versions of Firefox. <span>[Thanks Peter Gasston!]</span></p>

<h4>8. Cross-browser padding</h4>

<p>In the CSS box model, "padding" is the distance from a box edge to its inner stuff, whereas "margin" is the distance to stuff outside the box. Now, when you give something a specific width, say "200px" (200 pixels), and you add a padding of "10px", this means that the box has a width of 220 pixels (200 + 10 at the left side and + 10 at the right side). Probably not the most intuitive, and the programmers of older versions of Internet Explorers got it wrong and will not add the padding to the overall box size (so in IE5, the width is 200 pixels, even if there's a 10 pixel padding).</p>

<p>So if you need very precise box dimensions, one solution is to use a browser hack. It increases the maintenance efforts for your file, so use CSS hacks sparingly, and only when really needed. We can use this hack:</p>

<div><pre style="background-color:#eee;border:1px solid black;overflow:scroll;width:500px">.navigation
{
    padding-left: 10px;
    padding-right: 10px;
}

.navigation
{
    width: 200px;
}

.navi\gation
{
    width: 220px;
}</pre></div>

<p>The first selector is for all browsers and defines the basic box. The second selector is for conforming browsers who we hope to get the padding/ width calculation right. And the third selector is for older versions of Internet Explorer which we "hope" get the calculation wrong (per the W3C guidelines), so we help out a little by using a backslash preceding a selector letter that's in the range from g-z.</p>


<h4>9. CSS hacks</h4>

<p>A CSS hack basically means you&#39;re trying to &quot;split&quot; a portion of your stylesheet to target a specific (e.g. broken!) browser. There are many of these hacks around &#8211; maybe you want to target IE5+ with something, or maybe you want to target everything but Firefox 2, and so on. One way to search for new hacks is to go to Google Code Search and use the query <em><a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch?q=lang%3Acss+hack&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search+Code">lang:css hack</a></em>. You'll quickly find some inspiration. But don't let the dark side of the force corrupt you, Luke...</p>


<h4>10. Moving layers</h4>

<p>When you add animation to your page, and you don&#39;t go for Flash, you&#39;re typically using DHTML &#8211; the combination of HTML, JavaScript and CSS. One way I find to be neat for handling moving div layers &#8211; which can wrap anything, like animated sprites, a help monologue, and what-not &#8211; is to use a Sprite class in your JavaScript file. Yep, JavaScript allows you to create objects, only that they&#39;re calling it prototypes.</p>

<p>Now, your sprite object will mirror some of the values that exist in the world of CSS; for example, the sprite will have x and y properties (the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; of the CSS). Other values, like speedX or speedY (the object&#39;s velocity), or something more exotic like &quot;mood&quot; (the object&#39;s current behavior pattern, e.g. &quot;aggressively hunting player sprite&quot; vs &quot;calmly moving towards the edge of the screen&quot;), can be unique to your specific sprite class. You can then use a sprite array in your JavaScript file, let each object of this array &quot;grab&quot; its element &#8211; using document.getElementById(&quot;sprite&quot; + i) &#8211; and create a global setTimeout event to iterate over all sprites every few microseconds.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2006-08-08-n51.html"><img src="http://blog.outer-court.com/files/css-tips/king.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Here's some excerpted code to illustrate this with a living example from <a href="http://www.gamesforthebrain.com/game/colorlines/">this game</a> (also check out this type of <a href="http://www.outer-court.com/goodies/svg/sprite.js">sprite object JS</a> in other games). Basically I just needed to have a little king walk around at the bottom of the game, from left to right, showing different animation cells so it looks like he's moving his feet:</p>

<div><pre style="background-color:#eee;border:1px solid black;overflow:scroll;width:500px">var g_avatars = new Array();

....

function initAvatars()
{
    var i = 0;
    g_avatars[i] = new Avatar();
    g_avatars[i].x = 60;
    g_avatars[i].speedX = 6;
    g_avatars[i].y = 500;
    g_avatars[i].type = 1;
    g_avatars[i].limitX2 = 415;
}

...

function moveAvatars()
{
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; g_avatars.length; i++) {
        g_avatars[i].speedX *= .8;
        g_avatars[i].move();
        g_avatars[i].render();
    }
    setTimeout(&quot;moveAvatars()&quot;, g_avatarsDelay);
}

...

Avatar.prototype.move = function()
{
    var isMoving = this.speedX != 0 || this.speedY != 0;
    if ( isMoving || getRandomInt(0, 100) &lt;= 10 ) {
        if (--this.cellCounter &lt;= 0) {
            this.cellCounter = 5;
            if (++this.cell &gt; 2) {
                this.cell = 1;
            }
        }
    }

    this.x += this.speedX;
    this.y += this.speedY;

    if (this.x &gt; this.limitX2) {
        this.x = this.limitX2;
    }
    else if (this.x &lt; this.limitX1) {
        this.x = this.limitX1;
    }
}

function Avatar()
{
    this.x = 0;
    this.y = 0;
    this.speedX = 0;
    this.speedY = 0;
    this.cell = 1;
    this.cellCounter = 0;
    this.type = 1;
    this.limitX1 = 80;
    this.limitX2 = 1000;
    this.elm = document.getElementById(&quot;avatar&quot; + gAvatarId++);
