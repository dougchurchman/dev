So, just how much do you remember from high school geography?&#160; This is a fun, fast little game that&#39;ll test your reflexes as well as your recollection of capitals and famous places; and maybe you&#39;ll learn a few things as well.&#160; But I&#39;d suggest you practice a bit before you challenge your kids!&#160; <a href="http://www.minijuegosgratis.com/juegos/hwdykyworld/hwdykyworld.html?b415=0766">Link</a>, via <a href="http://www.neatorama.com/2007/11/19/how-well-do-you-know-your-world/">Neatorama.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p><a href="http://www.aperture.org/store/travex-detail.aspx?exhibition_id=45">Photographer Justin Guariglia spent eight years documenting the secretive warrior monks of the Shaolin Temple</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>With the blessing of the main abbot, Shi Yong Xin, Guariglia has earned the full collaboration of the monks to create an astonishing, empathic record of the Shaolin art forms and the individuals who consider themselves the keepers of these traditions. It is the first time the monks have allowed such extensive documentation of these masters and their centuries-old art forms-from Buddhist mudras to classical kung fu-in their original setting, a 1,500-year-old Buddhist temple.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://exposures.aperture.org/shaolin/">Photos and video here</a>. Watching the videos, especially the one featuring Tong Jian Quan, I was reminded of hip hop dancing (Michael Jackson in particular) in a way that watching kung-fu and other martial arts in Hollywood movies does not.</p>

<p>Also, Shaolin monk Hai Deng was famous for performing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3ubr1Z372Y">a one-finger handstand</a>. The video seems a little <a href="http://martial.best.vwh.net/forum/showthread.php?mode=hybrid&amp;t=36328">suspect</a> but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBXFTiRo_14">this performance</a> brings the single finger handstand into the realm of possibility.</p> (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/11/14547.html">link</a>)</div></div></div><div class='row'>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'>

<p>Last year I decided to put on twist on my annual "<a href="http://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-1825.cfm">best blogs</a>" post [<a href="http://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-464.cfm">2002</a>, <a href="http://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-661.cfm">2003</a>, <a href="http://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-748.cfm">2004</a>] by taking a turn toward the obscure. Because blogs now pervade the media landscape, it makes little sense to write a post arguing that Huffington Post is better or worse than DailyKos -- or Cute Overload.</p>

<p>It turned out that this change -- pointing to lesser-known sites like <a href="http://www.historyofthebutton.com/">History of the Button</a>, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzzfeed</a>, and <a href="http://indexed.blogspot.com/">Indexed</a> -- was a rather auspicious. Within 24 hours of releasing the list, seven of the top ten links on Del.icio.us' typically-tech-centric <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/">hotlist</a> were sites on my list. And so in the spirit of celebrating the lesser-known, it's time again to point toward the best blogs that might have flown under your radar. Here they are, the <strong>Best Blogs of 2007 that You Maybe Aren't Reading</strong>:</p>

<div><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/informedreader/"><img src="http://www.fimoculous.com/images/informedreader.jpg" width="60" height="60"></a><p><strong>30) <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/informedreader/">The Informed Reader</a></strong><br>As mainstream media organizations continue to close their foreign bureaus out of cost-saving desperation, the less expensive version -- "the international news blog" -- has become a staple property on nearly all sites (<a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/">nytimes.com,</a> <a href="http://worldblog.msnbc.msn.com/">msnbc.com</a>, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/exchange/blogs/in.the.field/">cnn.com</a>, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/georgepacker">newyorker.com</a>, etc.). Though the foreign news consumer might be tricked into believing these will reveal new forms of international reporting, it actually means that none of these sites stick out above the rest -- except for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>'s The Informed Reader, which somehow kept my attention this year by finding the right balance between gathering links and providing context.

This blog chronicles how past generations envisioned what the future would look like. With an archive that goes back to the 1880s, Paleo-Future is an essential compendium of a new historical category: nostalgic futurism.

This site (from my friend Gavin Purcell, whose day job is running <em>Attack of the Show</em> on G4) is religious in its pursuit to bring you the best moments of televised weirdness from the Land of the Rising Sun.

And every year a Metafilter post ridicules its inclusion -- can't wait to see this year's! My longstanding love-hate relationship with Metafilter (check the archives) tilted back toward the negative this year, which is why the Popular Favorites feature was almost a panacea for my frustration. More big sites are adding this "favoriting" feature (BoingBoing, Gothamist, etc.), which I initially appraised as a cheap way of avoiding depth, but now find the only way I can continue reading some sites.

One can read only so many snarky reviews of every episode of every reality tv show on every network every night (I know!). As an antidote to Perez Hilton's pretty hate machine, FourFour's Rich Juzwiak (whose day job is blogging for VH1) has carved out something unique in the pop landscape by balancing critical insight with a celebration for the lovable. And what does FourFour love? For starters: Tyra, America's Next Top Model, Beyonce, Tyra, Project Runway, and... Tyra.

Me: "Cuz they all talk about the same thing." Her: "Yes, but in many different ways." It's true, sex bloggers don't usually end up on this list, but Susannah Breslin's blog was one of the few sites in the genre to stay in the "to read" pile all year long.</p></div>

<div><a href="http://www.kanyeuniversecity.com/blog/"><img src="http://www.fimoculous.com/images/kanyewest.jpg" width="60" height="60"></a><p><strong>19) <a href="http://www.kanyeuniversecity.com/blog/">Kanye West: Blog</a></strong><br>Too much was made again this year about famous people getting blogs. Do you really want more insight into these people's opinions? Of course not -- you want to know their passions, their desires, their interest in dropping $7K on a bottle of cognac. Kanye's blog is more like a scrapbook of his id: some links (<em>hey look, the new Lupe Fiasco vid</em>), some photos (<em>hey look, a Delorean</em>), but surprisingly little ego.</p></div>

This is why Jezebel represents the biggest coup in the empire's history. Rather than beguile its way into the women's magazine industry, Jezebel burst onto the scene in May by defining itself in oppositional terms. It isn't so much a <em>thing</em> as it is <em>not those things</em>. To be clear: it is not the celeb porn that Conde Nast and Hearst have been splooging on you from newsstands for decades. Whereas the average Idolator post would fit in just fine in Blender or Pitchfork, Jezebel was an entire take-down of Glamour, Cosmo, and the rest of the airbrushed crew.

Twitter and Tumblr are the Rubik's Cube and the Tetris of the blogging world -- simple concepts that are immensely more complex and compelling than they logically should be. I've explained Twitter to a hundred people in a hundred different ways, each time not quite capturing why it's different, why it <em>matters</em>.

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>Last year, a friend of Greta's died tragically young. He was a pillar of the community, and Greta was honored to learn that he wanted her to play the oboe at his memorial service, which would be attended by hundreds of people. Greta has performed in countless concerts, with audiences just as large, but the thought of flubbing up at a ceremony honoring the life of a great man was absolutely nerve-wracking. The problem was compounded by the fact that Greta herself was in mourning for her friend. </p>

<p>In the end, she was able to summon up the courage to play beautifully, and received dozens of compliments after the service. One friend, a professional musician, asked about how she handled her nerves. She honestly told him that she didn't know: she just started playing and hoped for the best. He said that for high-pressure performances like that, he always used a beta-blocker -- a prescription medication for clinical anxiety. Indeed, the International Herald Tribune reports that using such drugs is becoming <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/20/features/jitters.php">routine</a> for musicians, whose reputation can be shattered by an ill-timed crack or bobble.</p>

<p>I certainly wouldn't have faulted Greta if she had sought out a prescription for such a drug when she learned of her friend's request in the weeks before he died. It's an exceptional situation, and if a little medication could help, wouldn't it be better for all concerned? But if musicians routinely depend on such drugs for everyday performances,  then where does it stop? Should we prescribe the drugs for students? At what age should they start?</p>

<p>This is just one facet of a broad debate opened up by a recent <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v450/n7173/full/4501157a.html">commentary</a> in Nature magazine. Barbara Sahakian and  Sharon Morein-Zamir argue that there are certain situations where cognitive enhancing drugs are perfectly reasonable. When someone suffers from a truly debilitating disorder, then if a drug can return some semblance of normal functioning, there's little question that it should be used, especially if there's no effective alternative treatment. But what about borderline cases?</p> <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2007/12/is_it_cheating_to_take_brainen.php">Read the rest of this post...</a> | <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2007/12/is_it_cheating_to_take_brainen.php#commentsArea">Read the comments on this post...</a><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/cognitivedaily/~4/203423181" height="1" width="1"></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>This year, the <a href="http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_index.html">Edge World Question Center</a> asks people what they have changed their minds about.  Here are excerpts from some of the most interesting answers.  (Not that I necessarily agree with them.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_1.html#ledoux">Joseph LeDoux</a> changed his mind about how memories are accessed in the brain.</p>
<blockquote><p>Like many scientists in the field of memory, I used to think that a memory is something stored in the brain and then accessed when used. Then, in 2000, a researcher in my lab, Karim Nader, did an experiment that convinced me, and many others, that our usual way of thinking was wrong. In a nutshell, what Karim showed was that each time a memory is used, it has to be restored as a new memory in order to be accessible later. The old memory is either not there or is inaccessible. In short, your memory about something is only as good as your last memory about it. This is why people who witness crimes testify about what they read in the paper rather than what they witnessed. Research on this topic, called reconsolidation, has become the basis of a possible treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, drug addiction, and any other disorder that is based on learning.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_4.html#norretranders">Tor N&#248;rretranders</a> now thinks that it&#8217;s more appropriate to think of your body as software, rather than hardware.</p>
<blockquote><p>What is constant in you is not material. An average person takes in 1.5 ton of matter every year as food, drinks and oxygen. All this matter has to learn to be you. Every year. New atoms will have to learn to remember your childhood.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_4.html#fisher">Helen Fischer</a> now believes that human beings are serial monogamists.</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps human parental bonds originally evolved to last only long enough to raise a single child through infancy, about four years, unless a second infant was conceived.  By age five, a youngster could be reared by mother and a host of relatives. Equally important, both parents could choose a new partner and bear more varied young.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_4.html#Steinhardt">Paul Steinhardt</a> is now skeptical about inflation.</p>
<blockquote><p> Most cosmologists would say the answer is &#8220;inflation,&#8221; and, until recently, I would have been among them. But &#8220;facts have changed my mind&#8221; &#8212; and I now feel compelled to seek a new explanation that may or may not incorporate inflation. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_5.html#baez">John Baez</a> is no longer enthusiastic about working on quantum gravity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Jaron Lanier put it this way: &#8220;One gets the impression that some physicists have gone for so long without any experimental data that might resolve the quantum-gravity debates that they are going a little crazy.&#8221;  But even more depressing was that as this debate raged on, cosmologists were making wonderful discoveries left and right, getting precise data about dark energy, dark matter and inflation.  None of this data could resolve the string-loop war! Why?  Because neither of the contending theories could make predictions about the numbers the cosmologists were measuring! Both theories were too flexible.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_7.html#jardin">Xeni Jardin</a> is depressed by the lack of spontaneous self-moderation in online communities&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>But then, the audience grew. Fast. And with that, grew the number of antisocial actors, &#8220;drive-by trolls,&#8221; people for whom dialogue wasn&#8217;t the point. It doesn&#8217;t take many of them to ruin the experience for much larger numbers of participants acting in good faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8230;but <a href="http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_6.html#kelly">Kevin Kelly</a> is impressed by the success of Wikipedia.</p>
<blockquote><p>How wrong I was. The success of the Wikipedia keeps surpassing my expectations. Despite the flaws of human nature, it keeps getting better. Both the weakness and virtues of individuals are transformed into common wealth, with a minimum of rules and elites. It turns out that with the right tools it is easier to restore damage text (the revert function on Wikipedia) than to create damage text (vandalism) in the first place, and so the good enough article prospers and continues. With the right tools, it turns out the collaborative community can outpace the same number of ambitious individuals competing.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_8.html#morton">Oliver Morton</a> has changed his mind about human spaceflight.</p>
<blockquote><p>I have, falteringly and with various intermediary about-faces and caveats, changed my mind about human spaceflight. I am of the generation to have had its childhood imagination stoked by the sight of Apollo missions on the television &#8212; I can&#8217;t put hand on heart and say I remember the Eagle landing, but I remember the sights of the moon relayed to our homes. I was fascinated by space and only through that, by way of the science fiction that a fascination with space inexorably led to, by science. And astronauts were what space was about.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_8.html#haidt">Jonathan Haidt</a> no longer believes that sports and fraternities are entirely bad.  (This is my favorite.)</p>
<blockquote><p>I was born without the neural cluster that makes boys find pleasure in moving balls and pucks around through space, and in talking endlessly about men who get paid to do such things. I always knew I could never join a fraternity or the military because I wouldn&#8217;t be able to fake the sports talk. By the time I became a professor I had developed the contempt that I think is widespread in academe for any institution that brings young men together to do groupish things. Primitive tribalism, I thought. Initiation rites, alcohol, sports, sexism, and baseball caps turn decent boys into knuckleheads. I&#8217;d have gladly voted to ban fraternities, ROTC, and most sports teams from my university.</p></blockquote>

I&#8217;d allowed my prejudices to dominate my reason. Those professors working in the countryside were being bludgeoned and humiliated. Those designers were put in the steel-foundries as &#8216;class enemies&#8217; &#8212; for the workers to vent their frustrations upon.

These unintended uses can be strange, even brilliant.   In the end, you have to tip your hat to the ingenuity. <br><br>To welcome 2008, the B&amp;A Staff digs into our collective experience to tell a few stories of misappropriation of both the real (things you can buy) and ephemeral (ideas and thoughts) that we misuse for our own devices.<br><br>We hope you find some inspiration and add stories of your own ingeniousness to the comments.<br><br>Happy New Year,<br><br>B&amp;A</p><p><span style="font-size:larger"><b>Unintended Uses and Innovation</b></span><br><br>Very often, people use things in ways never imagined by their inventors.

(Some IAs do use Excel for wireframes, you know).<br><br>Just consider the trash can propping open a door or that stack of books holding up the end of a broken shelf or the refrigerator door used as a bulletin board for the family.

Odd!<br><br>Here&#8217;s one thing I do: I use my browser bookmarks to manage passwords. After bookmarking a site that requires a password, I go into the properties of the bookmark and append the password to the title of it.

Probably not.<br><br>Improvising and re-purposing the objects around us is common. In the ethnographic research for my company, we try to focus on is unintended use. Where do people find work-arounds to the tools and software they normally use? Where do people find hacks? The answers to these questions often point to places where a system breaks down, where people need a better mouse trap. And this is where there is potential opportunity for innovation and where product developers can bring real value to their users.<br><br>But unintended uses are also something that usually don&#8217;t come out in things like questionnaires or even usability tests. Instead, you have to go out and observe people in the natural setting to get this type of insight.

A considerable part of my childhood was spent making paper airplanes in his print shop. I was obsessed with making and flying them; there was something fascinating about transforming an inert object&#8212;an incredibly simple one, at that&#8212;into something that could <i>soar</i>.<br><br>My brother and I created hundreds of paper airplane designs. The first were very simple: one folded sheet of paper. Later ones incorporated other materials: glue, tape, balsa wood, metal clips, electric motors, even small Hot Wheels cars. We learned basic principles of aeronautical engineering: how to balance the plane&#8217;s weight around the wing, how to shape wings for optimal lift (or speed, as need be), the functioning of the diverse control surfaces, etc. We challenged ourselves to make planes that could fly smoother, faster, higher, or just look (or fly) unusual. Our paper airplanes were more than mere toys: they were a basic design education.<br><br>Fast-forward thirty years. I hadn&#8217;t made a paper airplane in a long time&#8230; until my nephews came along. They seem fascinated by paper planes! And their uncle knows how to make <i>lots</i> of them. So what was originally my plaything and obsession has become a bridge that helps me connect with a new generation in my family.<br><br><em>You can&#8217;t buy paper airplanes, but you can make them easily enough.

However, I wasn&#8217;t too clear on what this actually <i>meant.</i> I&#8217;d known a few architects, but only had a very vague notion of what they did day-to-day. I was in for a shock.<br><br>The first couple of months in architecture school were among the most important in my life: I now had to think <i>about</i> and <i>through</i> design. My colleagues and I worked hard; the educaton of an architect is primarily a studio-based affair that entails long hours (&#8220;all-nighters&#8221; were common) and brutal group critiques. The objective seemed to be to understand (and exploit) the relationship between meaning/purpose, technology, and &#8220;human factors&#8221;. In the process I acquired many practical skills, ranging from arc welding to Photoshop. I was also exposed to concepts that changed my outlook on life: &#8220;Design Thinking&#8221;, Modernism, Derrida and those other nutty French post-structuralists.<br><br>Then something happened that would derail my plans: during my last semester, a friend from the Computer Science department showed me the internet. I was intrigued. Later&#8212;a year into my professional practice as an architect&#8212;I got on the web for the first time. It was clear to me that it was going to change the world, and that creating stuff on this medium would require an understanding of the relationsip between meaning/purpose, technology, and &#8220;human factors&#8221;&#8212;exactly what I&#8217;d been trained for.

Being somewhat a minimalist, it can be difficult to find gifts for me. I receive a lot of small art and kitchen gifts. I appreciate them immensely, but my entertainents rarely feature multiple courses (or sorbet), include 15 people, or require serving vessels. As a result, I didn&#8217;t use the bowls for about six months. They sat in forlorn neglect on my kitchen shelf, poking little pins of guilt into me on regular occasions.

One of my first thoughts was &quot;that&#8217;s 14 years of experience successfully binned&quot;. Was I wrong! The very skills of compassion and patience that I learned in the mental hospital (loony bin, nut factory, pick your euphemism) were precisely those needed with my students and (from time to time) my colleagues. While they have never threatened me and rarely yelled at me: they still have required a similar understanding as they pick their way through new territory. While the reasons for being there are different (pick a crime and I have worked with someone charged with it) the anxiety and fear are all too similar.

Later on, I would copy corporate logos on my notebooks at school and take notes on my history class in a medieval font.<br><br>Upon leaving high school I went directly to a school of communication that had great reputation in the local advertising industry. I deeply enjoyed my years at the communication school. We were taught the basics of visual design and worked hard on copywriting. We had creativity and non verbal communication workshops, and, of course, theory on communication, advertising, and social sciences research methods. We worked on practical campaigns, always with tight deadlines. At that time I did not have strong presentation skills, yet I was always the intellectual author behind the scenes.<br><br>One day during our communication theory class we came up to McLuhan; the teacher explained how he said that all media are extensions of our senses, like cameras being extensions of our eyes, but I was mesmerized by his statement that electronic media are direct extensions of our nervous system.

I bought a couple of packs then got myself some tempera paint, brushes, and a bunch of little nails. I went through all my magazines and picked out great photos of pearls and red paint and shoes. I painted the frames, put the magazine photos in the frames, and hammered the little nails into the top of the frames.

I knew I could write about it and I hoped that it would finally be my big break into the writing world. I hadn&#8217;t actually dated for four years. But that seemed like a moot point. I never actually intended to date; I just figured I&#8217;d post my profile on a bunch of sites to see how each worked and what kind of responses I got and that would be enough research. <br><br>Then, I got a response from an interesting guy. I gave in and went out. Suddenly I was dating. I was also writing my second book about online dating while working full-time at an office job. I never intended to date anyone seriously&#8212;who had the time? But once the second book was done, I found myself still surfing the online dating sites. And after several duds, I found myself out on a date with someone cute, funny, and really interesting. And he liked me, too.<br><br>Two years later we&#8217;re engaged to be married. The books did nothing for my career, but they found me him. And my life is infinitely better for writing them.<br><br><i> &#8212;Alyssa Wodtke</i><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size:larger"><b> Real: Alumninum teapot</b></span><br><br>I am slowly, reluctantly accepting that toothbrushes available on the market today will never, ever fit in the built-in toothbrush and cup holder of my 1929 bungalow.<br><br>When the thing I&#8217;d been using to contain brushes and paste finally rusted out, I went looking for a replacement. I wanted something funky and vaguely retro, but also something that could survive the inevitable fall onto the tile floor.

She talked, showed me pictures, asked me questions, and did a sketch. Only after the guys stopped digging, tidied up the mulch, and left did I realize: That sketch she&#8217;d done was a wireframe, and I though I&#8217;d thought I knew what she had said, it wasn&#8217;t until I saw the finished project and the consultants had all vanished that I realized I didn&#8217;t know how to read the wireframe or the specs.<br><br>Two epiphanies came from that experience:<br><br>One, that I need to be much more gracious and careful with my own commercial consulting clients, because my own fluency in wireframes is really an esoteric skill, and it&#8217;s not fair to expect them to understand me. I have to take time to teach.<br><br>Two, once I went back and reviewed my conversation with the designer and looked at the plants she&#8217;d chosen to put where, I knew I could do a better job than she&#8217;d done.<br><br>So, I started the landscape design professional development/certificate program at George Washington University. Twenty-some courses later, I&#8217;m doing landscape design as an occasional freelance gig. I thoroughly enjoy the pace and educating clients about native plants&#8212;but mostly I enjoy a living, tangible outcome from my efforts that smells nice, too.<br><br><i> &#8212;Cinnamon Melchor</i></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span style="font-size:larger"><b>Real: Office Supplies</b></span></p><p><img width="170" height="300" align="left" alt="small paperclip ornament" src="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/files/banda/our-way-the/paperclip-ornament_sm.jpg">I love office supplies.

There are many lessons you get seeing people interact with one of their three primal needs. You are all that stands between them and food; in fine dining you are what stands in the way&#8212;or stands behind&#8212;a good night out. In fine dining, the price is even more tangible. A fifty-year-old in a tuxedo can become a two-year-old in a second, and if you don&#8217;t feed him while stroking his ego, the de-evolution can go much farther.</p><p>For example, I know now that no matter how busy you are, the customer must feel like they are the only people in the world.  That means looking them in the eye and explaining slowly and patiently truffle risotto is not made with chocolate, even when your perepheral vision tells you one table doesn&#8217;t have water, another is waving at you desperately, and hot food is on the line with a rabid chef giving you the evil eye. The illustion of complete attention must not be broken! In the office, this translates to really listening to people when they talk to you, and not answering the phone or reading email. Humans don&#8217;t like to think they are the least interesting thing in the room. If you consider it, you probably wouldn&#8217;t like that either. Have you waited while your boss IM&#8217;s, or a coworker takes a call in the middle of you explaining a complex problem? Have you done this?</p><p>I also learned that no matter what happens, you can save or ruin the entire effort in the last few things you do. Give perfect service and then bring the check slowly, and the tip goes down the drain.  I swear you can lose a percentage point for every minute past when the diner wants the check  they have to wait. The same goes for everything else in life. You can do a perfect IA but have sloppy design or poor writing, and the IA doesn&#8217;t matter much to the overall usability. You can design a great shopping experience but a lousy cart, and there they go! Off to buy at Amazon! You can do a perfect spec for a brilliant product, but deliver late out of disorganization and no kudos for you &#8230; or worse, someone else beats you to market.  An experience isn&#8217;t a good one unless it&#8217;s good from start to finish, and finish is the lasting impression.</p><p>Finally I know from experience, &quot;I&#8217;m sorry &quot; can change everything. If you&#8217;ve messed up, forgotten an order, you gotta own up and apologize. Even if the kitchen overcooked the steak, it doens&#8217;t do to explain or or excuse: say you are sorry. You are the face of the restaraunt. Giving away a free dessert doesn&#8217;t hurt either &#8230; after all it&#8217;s the last thing they&#8217;ll remember.  And in the office, no matter how tempting it is to blame it on the other guy, apologize. If your team messes up and  you are design lead,  you must take responsibility as well.</p><p>Of course, a free dessert doesn&#8217;t hurt either.<br><br><i> &#8212;Christina Wodtke</i></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BoxesAndArrows_Stories/~4/211693145" height="1" width="1"></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>Van Mardian at <a href="http://decluttered.com">Declutter Your Desk</a> has sparked inspiration with a really clever way to deal with all the cables, connections and peripherals that make your desk a mess. He attached a pegboard to the underside of his desk and tied all those boxes and wires into a clean layout hidden from view. I especially like how he made the pegboard removable, so you don&#8217;t need to crawl around on your back to add or remove components. Total cost of the materials is $33.42 Canadian and around 2 hours of work. Awesome.</p>

<p>Colleague Fred Vogelstein has a <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgets/wireless/magazine/16-02/ff_iphone?currentPage=1">great article on the creation of the iPhone in the new issue of Wired</a>. It&#8217;s largely written based on anonymous sources (not a shock when dealing with Apple), but the narrative is quite compelling. I wish he got a bit more into just how much the iPhone has shaken up the wireless industry, but the article&#8217;s well-worth your time:</p>
<p style="text-indent:20pt">It was a late morning in the fall of 2006. Almost a year earlier, Steve Jobs had tasked about 200 of Apple&#8217;s top engineers with creating the iPhone. Yet here, in Apple&#8217;s boardroom, it was clear that the prototype was still a disaster. It wasn&#8217;t just buggy, it flat-out didn&#8217;t work. The phone dropped calls constantly, the battery stopped charging before it was full, data and applications routinely became corrupted and unusable. The list of problems seemed endless. At the end of the demo, Jobs fixed the dozen or so people in the room with a level stare and said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have a product yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s drama, folks.</p></div></div></div><h2><div align='left' class=PageTitle>Page 4 of 156</div><div align='right' class=PageNav><a href='DougShared003.html'> <<3 </a> - <a href='DougShared005.html'> 5>> </a></div></h2></div></body></html>
