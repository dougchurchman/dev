<p>To release the album <i><a title="Dylan &#8211; Everything Except Compromise" href="http://www.dylanmessaging.com/about">Dylan: His Greatest Hits</a></i>, a brilliant marketing idea was created: making a site with a <a title="Dylan &#8211; Everything Except Compromise" href="http://www.dylanmessaging.com/index.html">Dylan message generator</a>. You can go to the site and <a title="Dylan &#8211; Everything Except Compromise" href="http://www.dylanmessaging.com/create">create</a> a video message in up to "ten cards" to share with anyone you want. Designed by <a title="Ten4 Design" href="http://www.ten4design.co.uk/">Ten4 Design</a>, the generator uses the classic Bob Dylan video clip for the song "<a title="Subterranean Homesick Blues - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subterranean_Homesick_Blues">Subterranean Homesick Blues</a>", in which one he appears holding up <i>cue cards for the audience, with selected words and phrases from the lyrics.</i> The video is available to <a title="Dylan &#8211; Everything Except Compromise" href="http://www.dylanmessaging.com/watch">watch</a> on the site too.

<p>It works like this: you install the app and it runs an internal webserver that you connect to using safari on the iPhone. Whatever is running in iTunes on your computer shows up on the phone exactly as if it was in the iPod mode (with album art, controls, etc). So if you have an airport express hooked up to a stereo, you point your iTunes at the speakers and start playing some music, then walk away from your computer. </p>
<p>Once you pull up Signal in your phone, you can control your entire iTunes library remotely. You can pick playlists, set them to shuffle, change to specific songs, try different genres, even pull up podcasts and video. The interface on the iPhone is really what sells it &#8212; it looks and functions exactly like a real iPhone app, but it&#8217;s all in safari. It&#8217;s really quite amazing and turns the phone into a whole house audio remote for me.</p>

<p>When combined, ink line and watercolor create a lively visual interplay curiously pleasing to the eye.  Playing with these two rather different media is a good introduction for those new to sketching: the results are fun, unexpected, and often wonderful.</p>
<p>There are as many ways to create great sketches as there are artists.  I thought it would be helpful to show and describe my own step by step process, but keep in mind that what works best for each person will vary widely.  </p>
<p>When possible I do both the drawing and the painting on site.  The painting can be done later, if need be, but I strive to complete each sketch on the same day for best results.</p>
<p>Sketches with areas that are not completely defined or finished are especially intriguing.  The mind likes to have some work to do to fill in those gaps.  To that end, I try to leave areas or portions of objects un-drawn, un-painted, or un-detailed.</p>

<h2>Demonstration</h2>
<p>I did this sketch of a North Berkeley street corner (Shattuck Ave. &amp; Vine St.) one morning last month while sitting in my car, taking digital pictures along the way.  I have always liked this building, which houses a produce store on the ground floor, but had never sketched it.  The lamppost banner also caught my eye; I like to draw scenes with flags, signs and banners. This sketch spans one spread (5&#8243; x 7&#8243;) in my <a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/2007/09/08/sketching_materials#mat_books">sketchbook</a> and took about 30 minutes to complete, roughly split between drawing, painting, and waiting for paint to dry.</p>
<p></p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<h2>Drawing</h2>
<p>The drawing is done with a <a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/2007/09/08/sketching_materials#mat_pen">fountain pen</a> and <a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/2007/09/08/sketching_materials#mat_ink">waterproof ink</a>.  I try to stay loose; if I don&#8217;t like where a line ends up I just draw it again where I&#8217;d like it to be.  Also, I find that a somewhat interrupted line adds flavor and a sense of light to the scene.</p>
<p></p>
<div style="margin:0 0 0 20px">
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><b>Step 1:  Guide Lines</b></p>
<p></p>
<div><a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_1_650.jpg"><img width="275px" height="214px" src="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_1_275.jpg" alt="sketch_demo_step_1" title="Step 1"></a><br>
<span>Step 1: Guide Lines</span><span> [<a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_1_650.jpg">larger</a>]</span></div>
<p>I rarely bother with this step but wanted to show every contingency.  When the perspective of a scene is particularly tricky, or if I want to be sure to fit specific objects in a sketch, I will consider starting with some guide lines in pencil.</p>
<p>I take care that the lines are only positional cues and not drafts of the actual drawing; if I end up doing inking over completed pencil lines the results are stiff.  I draw the lines lightly: these are shown heavy so you can see them. </p>
<p>Here, the guide lines note the positioning of the main building and its turret roof, the foreground lamppost, the line of the Marin County hills in the distance, and the street level.  Streets are horizontal, but I felt like curving this one a bit; it seemed to help indicate that the block in the distance descends out of view.</p>
<p></p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><b>Step 2:  Foreground Objects</b></p>
<p></p>
<div><a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_2_650.jpg"><img width="275px" height="214px" src="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_2_275.jpg" alt="sketch_demo_2" title="Step 2"></a><br>
<span>Step 2: Foreground Objects </span><span> [<a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_2_650.jpg">larger</a>]</span></div>
<p>Although I don&#8217;t mind background lines occasionally showing through objects in from of them, I generally draw key foreground elements first to minimize this.  Note that from my vantage point the tip of the foreground street lamp intersected the top of the turret roof and the top of the post&#8217;s banner lined up with the horizontal roofline.  Compositionally this is awkward so I drew them with space in between.  Artistic license, you see!</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p></p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><b>Step 3: Outline Main Shapes</b><br>
</p>
<div><a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_3_650.jpg"><img src="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_3_275.jpg" alt="sketch_demo_3" width="275px" height="214px" title="Step 3"></a><br>

<p>I like to get all of the major shapes blocked in before adding a lot of detail, so that the overall structure of the drawing is established for later reference.  Here I outlined the main building and the tricky roof sections using the pencil lines as guides. </p>
<p></p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><b>Step 4: Fill In Foreground</b><br>
</p>
<div><a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_4_650.jpg"><img width="275px" height="214px" src="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_4_275.jpg" alt="sketch_demo_4" title="Step 4"></a><br>
<span>Step 4: Fill in Foreground </span><span> [<a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_4_650.jpg">larger</a>]</span></div>
<p>Next I finished up the objects in the foreground.  I like the plants on the median strip, so pulled them more into the view than they actually were and detailed them quite a bit.  The building on the left doesn&#8217;t add to the scene (although it&#8217;s a great clothing store <img src="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"> ), so I didn&#8217;t put in a lot of effort there.  I also inked in the line of the street on the left, deciding to curve it even more than I had originally indicated with the pencil guidelines.  </p>
<p></p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><b>Step 5: Details and Background</b><br>
</p>
<div><a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_5_650.jpg"><img width="275px" height="214px" src="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_5_275.jpg" alt="sketch_demo_5" title="Step 5"></a><br>
<span>Step 5: Details and Background </span><span> [<a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_5_650.jpg">larger</a>]</span></div>
<p>Once the basic layout of a sketch is established I start to fill in details.  I tackled the building itself, working from large areas (upper/lower floors, awning) to smaller (windows, door).  Although the blinds of the store were pulled shut, I knew that soon the windows would be filled with colorful produce so I put that in too.  The scene seemed barren without any people, so I invented some figures.  I also decided that adding a partially visible parked car would help indicate that the street descends out of view. </p>
<p>The background trees and the hills in the distance were then filled in, making sure that the pine trees clearly cross over the line of the hills in the distance to add interest to the skyline.</p>
<p></p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><b>Step 6: Hatching</b><br>
</p>
<div><a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_6_650.jpg"><img width="275px" height="214px" src="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_6_275.jpg" alt="sketch_demo_6" title="Step 6"></a><br>
<span>Step 6: Hatching </span><span> [<a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_6_650.jpg">larger</a>]</span></div>
<p>This step is relatively new for me, but I like the effect.  I add hatching to indicate some areas that are in shadow.  I do not hatch to indicate dark local color (the color something actually is: navy blue, for example, is a dark color), I just stick to cast shadows (in this sketch for example, under the awning) and the sides of objects that are dark because they are facing away from the light (here, the side of the building).  I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time on hatching and don&#8217;t strive to be too accurate: I just get some in there.</p>
<p>After all the ink has dried (about 3 minutes), I erase my pencil lines.
</p></div>
<p></p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<h2>Painting</h2>
<p>Drawing provides structure to the sketches, and watercolor livens them up.   I don&#8217;t so much <i>paint</i> my sketches though, as I <i>tint</i> them.  My colors tend to be on the light side, and muted.  This comes from working fast with a <a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/2007/09/08/sketching_materials#mat_box">small travel palette</a>, mixing pigments, and a lax attitude towards thorough brush and palette cleaning during the painting process.  I put down one, and at most two, layers of paint in any one area.  The <a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/moleskine-reloaded#mat_paper"> smooth watercolor paper</a> I use to facilitate drawing tends to create sharper paint edges and blotchier washes than traditional paper, but I like these effects.</p>
<p>Working small, I mix my colors on my <a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/2007/09/08/sketching_materials#mat_box">palette</a> rather than on the paper itself.  Water, as needed, comes from my <a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/2007/09/08/sketching_materials#mat_brush">waterbrush</a>.  I almost always create a color with two pigments (and maybe a smidge of a third): one pigment is too saturated (except for flowers and manmade objects), and three or more generally creates &#8220;muddy&#8221; colors, dull and flat.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t try to match the actual colors of things generally, unless color really distinguishes an object.  Out of habit I tend to stick to a <a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/2007/09/08/sketching_materials#mat_paint">small number of pigments</a> and mixes.  </p>
<p>Typical mixes are:</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p></p>
<div><img height="320px" width="90px" src="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/crop_d_web.jpg" alt="sketchbooks" title="Sketchbooks">
</div>
<ul>
<li> <b>French Ultramarine</b>+<b>Burnt Sienna</b>: blueish and brownish greys, and a soft black</li>
<li> <b>French Ultramarine</b>+<b>Permanent Alizerin Crimson</b>: variety of lavenders (smidge of <b>Burnt Sienna</b> to mute)</li>
<li> <b>Cobalt Blue</b>: water or sky</li>
<li> <b>Permanent Alizerin Crimson</b>+<b>Burnt Sienna</b>: Brick-like hues </li>
<li>Single pigments: Flowers, clothing, other manmade objects</li>
<li><b>Raw Sienna</b>, touch of <b>Permanent Rose</b>, sometimes smidge of <b>Cobalt Blue</b> or <b>Burnt Sienna</b>: Skin tones</li>
<li> <b>Raw Sienna</b>: Sunlight on things</li>
<li>any blue+any yellow:  natural greens</li>
</ul>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p>Color theory is a whole topic unto itself, but I follow a general trend of colors moving from warm to cool, saturated to muted and dark to light as they recede into the background.</p>
<p>Painting is done loosely, allowing specks of white paper to show through and both under- and overshooting inked edges.  The effect, something like an image printed off-register, adds vitality and sparkle to a line and wash drawing.</p>
<p></p>
<div style="margin:0 0 0 20px">
<div></div>
<p><b>Step 7: Foliage</b><br>
</p>
<div><a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_7_650.jpg"><img width="275px" height="214px" src="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_7_275.jpg" alt="sketch_demo_7" title="Step 7"></a><br>
<span>Step 7: Foliage</span><span> [<a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_7_650.jpg">larger</a>]</span></div>
<p>What to paint first?  I try to pick whatever part of a scene I would like to have for reference when mixing other colors.  I might choose the shadow areas, darkest spots, bright (saturated) areas of color, a very particular color I want to recreate, or areas that have colors that need to contrast well with adjoining areas.</p>
<p>In this scene not only is the building green, but there is a lot of green foliage as well; differentiating these is a challenge.  One solution would be to make the building a different color, but the color of this building is part of its identity and charm, so I didn&#8217;t want to do that.  I decided to paint the varying greens of the foliage first to serve as a reference when painting the building.  I created a variety of greens using various mixes of <b>French Ultramarine</b>+<b>Aureolin</b> and <b>Cobalt Blue</b>+<b>Aureolin</b> in the foreground and <b>French Ultramarine</b>+<b>Raw Sienna</b> in the background. After the foliage was complete I let it all dry.</p>
<p></p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><b>Step 8: Saturated Highlights: </b><br>
</p>
<div><a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_8_650.jpg"><img width="275px" height="214px" src="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_8_275.jpg" alt="sketch_demo_8" title="Step 8"></a><br>
<span>Step 8: Saturated Highlights</span><span> [<a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_8_650.jpg">larger</a>]</span></div>
<p>Next I painted snippets of saturated color that I wanted to remain distinctive so that they would not be overshadowed later on.  These included the people, newspaper box, flowers, store produce and street lights. I also decided to add redder color to some of the trees.  </p>
<p></p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p><b>Step 9:   Darks and Shadows </b></p>
<p>Next I considered the posts and parking meter.  I decided to make the post directly in front of the building dark so that it would show well in front of the light building.  I wanted to keep the parking meter light since it would be surrounded by dark shadows, and I decided the post beside it should be dark to contrast with the hills and trees beyond.  I wasn&#8217;t sure about the foreground post, so left it unpainted for the time being.  The posts were painted in <b>French Ultramarine</b>+<b>Burnt Sienna</b> grays and let dry.</p>
<p></p>
<div><a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_9_650.jpg"><img width="275px" height="214px" src="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_9_275.jpg" alt="berkeley_corner" title="Step 9/10/11"></a><br>
<span>Steps 9, 10 &amp; 11: Shadows, <br>More Color, and Finishing</span><span> [<a href="http://www.trumpetvine.com/sketchblog/wp-content/images/2007.09/step_9_650.jpg">larger</a>]</span></div>
<p>Sometimes I paint an area&#8217;s basic color and then add the shadows on top when the first layer is dry, but more often I just paint the shadows in directly.  Here I painted all of the shadows, hatched and un-hatched, except  the lacy tree shadows on the building, with <b>French Ultramarine</b>+<b>Alizerin Crimson</b>+smidge of <b>Burnt Sienna</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Step 10: Remaining Color</b></p>
<p>Next I painted the roof with <b>French Ultramarine</b>+<b>Burnt Sienna</b>.  This is a large area in the painting so I made sure to apply it loosely.  I did the roof in two coats: an initial pass and then once that dried, a second pass on some areas I wanted darker.</p>
<p>Now to tackle the building.  I wanted a green that would be distinctly different from the natural greens in the scene, so I started with a bit of <b>Phthalo Green</b>.  This pigment has an artificial hue not found in nature so I never use it for greenery, but it can be good for manmade objects that are green (like awnings and sun umbrellas). However, it is a very intense pigment so I just used a dab of it and added a bunch of <b>French Ultramarine</b> and water.  I painted the building as loosely as I could, leaving the framing planks white.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Step 11: Finishing Up</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know when to stop.  At this stage I thought long and hard about what color to paint the awning.  I couldn&#8217;t come up with any great ideas, so decided to just leave it unpainted and went ahead and added the lacy tree shadows to the front of the building and awning with <b>French Ultramarine</b>+<b>Alizerin Crimson</b>.</p>
<p>Given my decision regarding the awning, I decided to leave the foreground pole with its banner and sign white as well.    Originally I had envisioned that banner being a bright, perky highlight of the sketch and it ended up quite differently, but that&#8217;s exactly what happens in the course of making a quick sketch.  At any rate, in the spirit of leaving things undone it worked for me.  I <i>was</i> pretty sure early on that I was going to leave the street white and that did prove to be true.  </p>

</p>

<p>Paul Krugman recently <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/introducing-this-blog/">blogged</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The middle-class society I grew up in didn&#8217;t evolve gradually or automatically.&#160; It was <em>created</em>,
in a remarkably short period of time, by FDR and the New Deal.&#160; As the
chart shows, income inequality declined drastically from the late 1930s
to the mid 1940s, with the rich losing ground while working Americans
saw unprecedented gains.</p></blockquote><p>As you can see, the share of the top ten percent (not counting capital gains) falls steeply at about 1937 and flattens out by about 1942-43, with a slight uptick just afterwards.&#160; But I am puzzled by Krugman&#39;s description of the process.&#160; A few points:</p>

<p>1. 1937-38 were disastrous years for the American economy and also for the middle class, mostly because of bad contractionary monetary policy.&#160; This can be considered a second Great Depression and it aborted a recovery in process.&#160; Robert Higgs has shown convincingly that World War II was an economic disaster, look at the figures at consumption don&#39;t be fooled by aggregate gdp which is inflated by production for the war.</p>

<p>2. Therefore I am not sure when the &quot;unprecedented gains&quot; came during this period.&#160; Yes 1940 was a year of recovery (and part of 1939) but is the claim that the middle class was created in that year?&#160; Surely not but then I am confused.</p>

<p>3. Krugman cites &quot;strong unions, a high minimum wage, and a progressive tax system&quot; as driving the Great Compression -- did these factors change so notably in 1937-44?</p>

<p>4. In real terms, relative to the time, the new federal minimum wage of 1938 was <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/anth484/minwage.html">not especially high</a>, even compared to the minimum wage today.&#160; And the data are for pre-tax incomes, which means that progressive taxation is unlikely the major part of the story about the distribution of pre-tax income (noting the Yglesias caveat that the rate of tax will influence pre-tax incomes through labor supply).</p>

<p>5. Here are <a href="http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/friedman.unions.us">some data on U.S. unionization</a>.&#160; The history does broadly track Krugman&#39;s time frame, as long as one does not obsess over 1937-43 as being special.&#160; Note that optimistic estimates of the union wage premium today run about 15 percent, so it is hard to see unionization as the dominant factor in the change in the distribution of income.</p>

<p>6. The wartime economy, and the scarcity of labor, bid up wages for black workers, women, and many remaining non-drafted male laborers (due to forced saving, however, consumption was low).</p>

<p>7. My explanation of the break in the chart emphasizes a combination of events: top incomes were crushed by the depression of 1937-8, the war economy put a further lid on top of high incomes (for reasons of law and norms; surely the phrase &quot;wartime wage and price controls&quot; deserves to be uttered at least once), and the war economy bid up wages for many people near the bottom and middle of the distribution.&#160; The wealthy classes financed a disproportionate chunk of World War II, it seems.</p>

<p>8. Krugman mentions none of the factors listed in #7.&#160; Admittedly I may be wrong, but are not those factors obvious <em>candidates</em> for an explanation?</p>

<p>9. It is a vitally interesting question why postwar America stayed at this new percentile distribution of income (more or less), even after recovery from the war.&#160; It may be possible to defend a version of Krugman&#39;s broader hypothesis -- policy matters for income distribution -- in this setting, but the story then puts greater stress on both the equalizing effects of catastrophes and also on path-dependence.&#160; That story might also suggest that strongly negative real shocks would be needed once again to make income distribution much more egalitarian.</p>

<p>10. How about this for an alternative story: &quot;Crush the incomes at the top and then make the fat cats pay much higher wages to protect the world and become a superpower.&#160; Impose wage and price controls as well.&#160; See how long it takes before these distributional effects -- which don&#39;t exactly match the distribution of economic talent-- reverse themselves in the aggregate.&quot;&#160; I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s right but at least it seems to match more of the history.</p>

<p>I am sensitive to the claim that many people misinterpret the words of Paul Krugman, so please do read his whole post.&#160; If he addresses these matters in more detail in his forthcoming book, I will let you know.</p></div></div></div><div class='row'>

Have a few hundred harried lunches wolfing down a burrito
while answering email made you a little chubby? Brian Wansink has some advice
for you, and it's not trading the burrito for a salad. Just stop emailing while
you eat. </p>



<p>But you don't have to give up multitasking altogether: talk
on the phone instead (rude though it may be). His research suggests that while
talking on the phone, you'll eat less and like your food better too, even from
the nasty Chinese place on the corner. </p>



<p>You've heard quackery like this before, right? Wrong. </p>



<p>Brian Wansink is no new-age diet doctor. He's the Director
of the <a href="http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/index.htm">Food and Brand Lab</a> at Cornell, where a funhouse of one-way mirrors helps
him spy into the hidden psychology behind Americans' prodigious food intake. </p>



<p>Here's a test you can do at home. Take two glasses. Make
sure one is stubby, the other tall and skinny. Now pour the same amount of beer
in each glass. Chances are you just poured 34 percent more into the short
glass. Didn't think you would? He knew you'd say that too. Wansink is in your
head.</p>

<p>We reached him over the phone in Ithaca to discuss
connections between the size of your plates and those saber-tooth tigers that
evolutionary psychologists love. </p>

<p><strong>Wired News:</strong> Tell me about this so-called Food and Brand Lab? How is it laboratorial?
<strong><br>Brian Wansink:</strong> People typically think of wet labs where there are beakers and crazy scientists with Einstein hair. But the essential thing labs try to determine is causality: if you do something to this hamster, will it respond in this way or that way? We're not studying proteins in rodents. We're studying people using the same scientific method.

</p>

<p>The physical space itself has one-way mirrors connected with kitchens that connect into different rooms that I can make look like a den or dining room.&#160; 

<strong><br><br>WN:</strong> Do you see yourself as a scientist? A freakonomicist? A sociologist?
<strong><br>Wansink:</strong> In some cases, if you fall solidly between a bunch of fields, that&#39;s something that you just deal with. Any one of those fields will embrace the articles that you publish within that field, but not the others. That&#39;s the blessing and the curse of being between those fields.&#160; 

<strong><br><br>WN:</strong> Do you see yourself as part of the food industry or as an outside critic?
<strong><br>Wansink:</strong> We don&#39;t take any funding from the food industry but also we don&#39;t criticize the food industry either. We believe most of the things that trick people into overeating are often the result of how we set up our own environments. We end up much more guilty of booby-trapping our lives than any company could be.&#160; 

<strong><br><br>WN:</strong> What are some examples of &quot;booby-trapping&quot;?
<strong><br>Wansink:</strong> Take the simple idea of serving bowl. If people leave a serving bowl on their table, even if it&#39;s something they don&#39;t like, they end up eating 30 percent more than if they move the serving bowl 6 feet away by the stove. Or plate size. People end up serving themselves 25 percent more on a 12 inch plate than on a 10 inch plate. But if you ask them about it, they&#39;ll deny that.&#160; 

<strong><br><br>WN: </strong>A lot of Wired readers spend a lot of time at desks, in front of their computers. Have you done any research on eating at your desk?
<strong><br>Wansink:</strong> We've done a couple things with desktop dining. We bring people in and give them pizza and Mountain Dew. But we have them do different tasks like answering email, surfing the web, or talking on the phone while they eat.

When they talked on the phone, they ate the least but they liked their food the most. People ended up eating the most and the fastest and liking it the least when they were answering emails. Surfing the web was in-between, like magazine reading. 

<strong><br><br>WN:</strong> What kinds of brain processes are driving these things?
<strong><br>Wansink:</strong> Automaticity, which says that a lot of our behavior is automatic or scripted once we do something enough times, like driving to work. We just trip the brain macro and go. Automaticity is important because in some ways it suggests that we're not as much the master and commander of all our choices as we think we are. There are certain decision defaults that guide our behavior. We can either acknowledge they happen or deny that they happen. But they are going to happen. 

<strong><br><br>WN:</strong> What's the benefit of going on autopilot? What's the advantage to the human animal?
<strong><br>Wansink:</strong> We&#39;re very much cognitive misers. Our ancestors only allocated enough attention to eating as it required, so they could be vigilantly looking out for mating opportunities or sabertooth tigers that might jump us. That&#39;s the same situation we&#39;re in, but maybe with fewer saber tooth tigers. We don&#39;t want to focus all our concentration on &quot;Must&#8230; not&#8230; overserve&#8230; self.&quot; We have a million other things to think about. 

</p>

<p><strong>WN:</strong> What about food labels? Are they helpful?
<br><strong>Wansink:</strong> In every study we do, regardless of what focus is, there&#39;s about 15-20 percent of the people who look at the food label and read it and process it accurately. Of course, 70 percent of people say they do, but they don&#39;t. Plus, if you give someone something and say it&#39;s organic or pesticide-free or low-fat, there&#39;s a health halo that kicks in. People believe it has fewer calories and is more nutritious, so they eat more of it.&#160; 

<strong><br><br>WN:</strong> Then how do we keep people from eating all the bad stuff?
<strong><br>Wansink:</strong> During the last year or two, I&#39;ve really changed a lot of my thinking. I used to think that awareness was the solution. I&#39;m now convinced that it has nothing do with behavior change. If awareness were the answer, we&#39;d all be rich, skinny, and athletic.&#160; 

</p>

<p><strong>WN:</strong> If how we educate consumers is not the question to be asking, what is the right question?<strong><br>Wansink:</strong> What is the best way to mindlessly change behavior? Simply and metaphorically, we need to put the serving bowl back by the stove. Smaller plates. Taller, skinnier glasses. That's what we want to go for. Things they don't have to think about. It's not about educating people.

Part of it relates to economics, I don't mean dollars and cents. I mean the economics of cognitive effort and the economics of physical effort. Here's an example. We eat a lot less of the Oreos that come in mini-packs of 2 or 3 because there's a little cognitive cost and a little physical cost to opening another little package. We have to pause and think. 

<strong><br></strong></p>

<p><strong>WN:</strong> Why'd you choose to study food?
<strong><br>Wansink:</strong> I grew up in farm county and growing up as a little boy in Iowa, I'd spend my summer selling fruits and vegetables door to door. If you look at academics who are really impassioned in their field of study, you end up seeing some sort of connection to when they were growing up. It's very common with entomologists. They had bug collections as kids. </p>

<br>
No fewer than four of you sent this along, so although <a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/polardog.asp">Snopes says it was collected in 2006</a>, and confirms that it happened and was published last year, sometimes it takes a while for something to catch on, on the net.<br>
<br>
Photographer Norbert Rosing was out on a photo session with these dogs, in the middle of nowhere, Hudson Bay in northern Canada - when a 1200 pound polar bear appeared on the scene.<br>
<br>
But incredibly, the outcome wasn't an eaten dog.  It was a half-hour session of... <i>play.</i><br>
<br>
<a href="http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/play/audiogallery/soundseen.shtml">Stuart Brown narrates a slide show of the event</a>, in which he interprets the gestures of both animals as signals to play; the dog's mouth without fangs, the bear's ears back.<br>
<br>
Snopes is, as Snopes must always be, a little skeptical that this was play - but dog owners have seen this sort of thing before in their dogs, and hey, if a polar bear is hungry and wants to eat, let's admit it, the dog is probably toast.<br>
<br>
But the slideshow says the bear returned every night for a week to play again.  I for one am encouraged to believe it was play; the modern dog, even the husky, is play-oriented.  And why shouldn't the bear get something out of it?  He's not going to be concerned for his safety, so why not the occasional social move?<br>

<p><em>Getting around New York City can sometimes be a bewildering experience. Help is on the way.</em></p>

<p>Now the city is experimenting with a new way to help people go where they want to go without wasting more steps than they have to. The city and the private business improvement district for the neighborhood around Grand Central Terminal have installed compass-shaped decals on sidewalks, right where riders emerge from heavily used subway stairwells.<br><br>The gold-on-black decals are 24 inches in diameter, larger than a large pizza but smaller than a manhole cover. They carry two kinds of information: directions for north, east, south and west, and the names of the nearest streets.<br><br>Should the first decals prove to be a hit, city officials hope they can team up with other business improvement districts and propagate the decals in other parts of the city where exiting subway riders could use a guide.<br><br>One of the decals that officials showed off yesterday is on 42nd Street near Third Avenue, outside a passageway between a Starbucks and a Foot Locker store that leads to and from the subway. It got mostly good reviews from people who noticed it as they walked by.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'>I read various game forums from time to time, and often see gamers complaining about 'lazy ports' to the ps3. They often mention how the ps3 is the most powerful game console and blame developers working on the console for doing a bad job. Sony has all of these people duped by impressive marketing spin, and I'm often amazed at how potent this type of rhetoric proves to be. For those unaware, I'm going to break it down simply and explain exactly why ports to the ps3 will never be as good as their 360 counter parts, and why most ps3 exclusives will likely continue to suck. First, lets debunk a few common misconceptions:<br><br>"The PS3 is more graphically advanced than the 360"<br><br>Fill rate is one of the primary ways to measure graphics performance - in essence, it's a number describing how many pixel operations you can perform. The fill rate on the PS3 is significantly slower than on the 360, meaning that games either have to run at lower resolution or use simpler shader effects to achieve the same performance. Additionally, the shader processing on the ps3 is significantly slower than on the 360, which means that a normal map takes more fill rate to draw on the ps3 than it does on the 360. And I'm not talking about small differences here, we're talking roughly half the pixel pushing power.<br><br>"Ok, fine, but the cell is like, super powerful"<br><br>In theory, sure, but in reality it doesn't work out that way. Game code simply doesn't split well across multiple processors. You can probably find a way to split a few things off fairly easily - put the audio on one processor, animation on another; but generally the breakup is always going to leave several of the SPUs idle or underutilized. On top of that, it's usually not CPU speed that restricts the visuals in games - it's fill rate.<br><br>"Uh, Blue Ray!"<br><br>Great for watching movies, but not so great for games. Getting data off the blue ray drive takes about twice as long as it does to get the same data off the 360's DVD drive. That translates into longer load times, or god forbid if your streaming from disk, tighter constraints on the amount of data you can stream.<br><br>"But it's got a lot more space than DVD"<br><br>Ok, you got me there - it does have a lot more space, and there is the potential to use that to do something cool, but thats unlikely to be realized in any useful way. There are tons of compression techniques available for data and I'd personally rather be able to get my data faster than have more of it. Most developers who use the entire Blue Ray drive are doing it to work around other problems with the ps3 such as it's slow loading - for instance, in Resistance: Fall of Man, every art asset is stored on disk once for every level that uses it. So rather than storing one copy of a texture, you're storing it 12 times. If you took that entire game and removed all the duplicate data, it would likely fit on a DVD without any problem. They do this to speed up load times, which, as I pointed out before, are painfully slow on the ps3. So in this case, the extra space is completely wasted.<br><br>"Once developers figure out the PS3 they'll maximize the hardware and it will be amazing"<br><br>I suspect a small number of PS3 only developers will optimize the hardware to do something cool. However, this will be an exception to the rule, and will likely involved game designs that are specifically designed for the hardware and funded by Sony. If those will prove to be fun or not is another question.<br><br>Most of the performance centric research into the PS3 has been around making it easier for developers to get the same level of performance you get out of the 360 naturally. For instance, some developers are using those extra SPU's on the cell to prepare data for the rendering pipeline. Basically, they take the data they would normally send to the graphics chip, send it to an SPU which optimizes it in some manner, then send it to the graphics chip. So, once again we see an 'advantage' in hardware being used to make up for a disadvantage in another area - a common theme with the ps3. And this introduces an extra frame of latency into the equation, making controller response slower.<br><br>So, the common theme is this; developers must spend significantly more time and resources getting the PS3 to do what the 360 can already do easily and with a lot less code. Lets look at how this translates into practical realities for a moment:<br><br>Why the PS3 version often pails in comparison to the 360 version, and why exclusives often suck:<br><br>As outlined above, getting equivalent performance out of the PS3 requires a lot of work unique to the platform, and in many cases, even with all these tricks, you still won't see equivalent performance. Thus, many ps3 games have simplified shaders and run at lower native resolutions than the 360 versions. On top of this, there is shrinking incentive to do this work; the PS3 isn't selling.<br><br>The code needed to make the PS3 work is most likely only useful to you on the PS3, as the types of tricks you need to do to make the thing perform are very unique to the platform and unlikely to be useful on any other architecture now or in the future. These issues all stem from unbalanced hardware design, and any future hardware that is this unbalanced will likely be unbalanced in a completely unique way.<br><br>Finally, there's the problem of resources. Game Development is, at it's heart, a resource management challenge. Given finite resources, do I have these five engineers work on optimizing the PS3 version to look better, or do I use them to make the game play better and fix bugs? Do I change my design to fit with what the PS3 hardware does well, or simply run the game at a slightly lower resolution on the PS3 to make up for it? Developers striving to push the PS3 hardware have often sacrificed their game in the process.<br><br>This post might come across as a lot of Sony bashing, but it's just the reality from the trenches. Sony let their hardware be designed by a comity of business interests rather than a well thought out design that would serve the game development community. They are going to loose hard this round because of it, and I hope that in the next round they take lessons from this round and produce a more balanced and usable machine.</div></div></div><div class='row'>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p><img src="http://blogoscoped.com/files/vectormagic.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Stanford University&#8217;s <a href="http://vectormagic.stanford.edu">VectorMagic</a> is an incredibly useful Flash-based online app that converts a bitmap image of yours (e.g. a PNG file) into a vector file (e.g. EPS).</p>

<p>One use-case is to grab a given graphic to then increase its size nearly loss-free. For instance, I submitted the <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/files/logo-80-percent.png">logo of this blog</a>, converted it with VectorMagic, saved as EPS (the SVG file was broken for me for some reason), and imported the EPS back into PhotoPaint to save as <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/files/logo-80-percent-vectormagic.png">new, larger PNG</a> again. (Note CorelDraw already ships with CorelTrace to vectorize graphics, but other photo editors may not.)</p>

<p>Another use for this is to create more abstract, smooth versions of existing photos. I uploaded a <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/files/tor-woman.jpg">photograph portrait</a> found on Flickr (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bespoke/1732657540/">photo</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/deed.en">CC-licensed</a> by <a href="http://bespoke.org">Tor Kristensen</a>) and converted it into a <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/files/tor-woman-vectormagic.png">vector portrait</a>.
I then applied a strong smart blur filter in PhotoPaint &#8211; it&#8217;s like blurring, but keeps certain edges intact &#8211; for <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/files/tor-woman-vectormagic-smooth.jpg">a new result</a>.
</p>

<p>Come to think of, it would be very cool to have an open online photo editor that would allow all kinds of third-parties to write filter gadgets. They would get an input PNG file from the photo editor, communicate about the filter options needed in some structured way (or get an Iframe&#8217;d place to show their own interface), and provide back an output PNG file. And while the filter processes, display some of their ads in a small designated area to make their work &amp; CPU-cycles spent worthwhile. A filter directory could be attached to the online photo editor &#8211; similar to say iGoogle + the iGoogle gadget directory &#8211; and popular filters can be included by default. There are various nice online filters, <a href="http://rsizr.com">some of them</a> much more impressive than what&#8217;s available in traditional desktop apps,  but they&#8217;re currently scattered all around the web.</p>

AOL Spinner blog posted a slideshow the other day of <a href="http://www.spinner.com/2007/11/05/winona-ryder-dates-another-musician/">the 20+ musicians that <strong>Winona Ryder</strong> has been romantically linked to over the years</a>.

And that was Frank "Francis" Bannerman. <br>Bannerman, we learn, "bought up ninety per cent of all captured guns, ammunition, and other equipment auctioned off after the Spanish-American War. He also bought weapons directly from the Spanish government before it evacuated Cuba. These purchases vastly exceeded the firm&#8217;s capacity at its store in Manhattan and filled three huge Brooklyn warehouses with munitions, including thirty million cartridges." Accordinglty, "Bannerman now needed an arsenal."<br>Or, more accurately speaking: he needed a private island. <br><br><img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 8px;text-align:center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2403/1985768996_07ced1fdfd_o.jpg" width="475" height="209" border="0" alt=""><small>[Image: <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/bannermans/index.htm">Bannerman's Island</a>, copyright <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/">Shaun O'Boyle</a>].</small><br><br>Bannerman soon purchased "six and a half acres of scrub-covered rock called Polopel&#8217;s Island, about fifty-five miles north of New York City." But even that wasn't enough. He then "bought seven acres more of underwater land in front of the island from the state of New York. He ringed the submerged area with sunken canalboats, barges, and railroad floats to form a breakwater" &#8211; a kind of artificial reef.<br>"The island was under continuous construction for eighteen years."<br><br><img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 8px;text-align:center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2133/1985768834_09e98bd6ef_o.jpg" width="475" height="267" border="0" alt=""><small>[Image: <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/bannermans/index.htm">Bannerman's Island</a>, copyright <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/">Shaun O'Boyle</a>].</small><br><br>Quoting at length:<ul>The castle was Bannerman&#8217;s vision and his execution. It was creviced and encrusted with battlements, towers, turrets, crenellations, parapets, embrasures, casements, and corbelling. Huge iron baskets suspended from the castle corners held gas-fed lamps that burned in the night like ancient torches. By day Bannerman&#8217;s castle gave the river a fairyland aspect. By night it threw a brooding silhouette against the Hudson skyline.</ul><img style="display:block;margin:23px auto 8px;text-align:center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2039/1985768864_806f97f8ac_o.jpg" width="475" height="323" border="0" alt=""><small>[Image: <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/bannermans/index.htm">Bannerman's Island</a>, copyright <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/">Shaun O'Boyle</a>].</small><br><br>More:<ul>Visitors approached the place along a breakwater bristling with cannon and then passed through an opening flanked by two watchtowers. After tying up their boat at a large unloading dock they crossed a moat spanned by a drawbridge and passed under a portcullis crowned by the Bannerman coat of arms carved in stone.</ul>Bannerman died a week after the end of World War I &#8211; and the island had sunk into a state of "monumental decay" by the 1960s. <br>It was then gutted by arsonists. <br>And then photographer <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/bannermans/index.htm">Shaun O'Boyle</a> came into the picture. <br><br><img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 8px;text-align:center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2404/1985769002_4abf8e8b25_o.jpg" width="475" height="316" border="0" alt=""><small>[Image: <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/bannermans/index.htm">Bannerman's Island</a>, copyright <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/">Shaun O'Boyle</a>].</small><br><br>"I found the island," Shaun explained to me over email, "while commuting to NYC via the Amtrak train along the east bank of the Hudson River, which passes by the island and is plainly visible. It is located north of Cold Spring, NY, and can be seen when crossing the Beacon Bridge." <br>"New York state owns the island now," O'Boyle added, "and there are renovations going on, but I'm not sure what their plans are for public access. You can take tours of the island, via kayak, or motor boat."<br><br><img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 8px;text-align:center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2075/1985777524_8fb0e897cb_o.jpg" width="475" height="325" border="0" alt=""><small>[Image: <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/bannermans/index.htm">Bannerman's Island</a>, copyright <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/">Shaun O'Boyle</a>].</small><br><br>O'Boyle goes on to describe how he "explored the island using a kayak with friends," and that he's "made 3 visits, 2 in the past 2 years. The last visit we climbed the mountain adjacent to the river," he adds, "and that is where the aerial views are from."<br>When I asked him about what appear to be flooded foundation walls, ringing the island like a tropical atoll, Shaun said: "What look like sunken foundations in the Hudson are actually part of the breakwater constructed to form a harbor for unloading the ships of supplies." <br>And when I asked him about the actual construction of the building &#8211; how the ruined walls handle themselves today, maintaining their shape and structure &#8211; O'Boyle wrote that "the construction quality was lacking, and I heard that Bannerman used old musket barrels to reinforce some of the concrete walls." <br>Architecture as a kind of thinly described weapon: like almost all archaeology, scrape deep enough and you'll uncover the residues of warfare. <br><br><img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 8px;text-align:center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2380/1987407670_18de375fe9_o.jpg" width="475" height="226" border="0" alt=""><small>[Images: <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/bannermans/index.htm">Bannerman's Island</a>, copyright <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/">Shaun O'Boyle</a>].</small><br><br>O'Boyle:<ul>The island is a beautiful place. I have been there in the mid-summer only, and thick vegetation covers everything, making it a challenge to move around anywhere but the paths. It certainly is a different kind of ruin for me to photograph: most of my photography work is of large scale <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/rankin/index.htm">industrial ruins</a>, like <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/steel/index.htm">Bethlehem Steel</a>, and some of the industries that feed the steel mills &#8211; like <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/snb/index.htm">coal</a> and <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/mine/index.htm">mining</a>. Although my latest work is a bit different, I have been photographing the coal mining region of Pennsylvania &#8211; the towns, buildings and landscapes. It's a fascinating area. But Bannerman's is a more romantic ruin, set among the beautiful hills of the Hudson river.</ul>It's also the perfect setting for a future <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/possibility-of-secret-passageways.html">Patrick McGrath</a> novel. <br>And the island &#8211; or at least Bannerman's arsenal &#8211; has had its effects elsewhere. As O'Boyle explained, Bannerman "published a catalogue of all his products &#8211; <i>Bannermans Catalogue</i> &#8211; and, in fact, I currently have a 1925 edition on order from a used book store. Word has it that many of the canons you find in front of American Legions and town halls around the country are from Bannermans."<br><br><img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 8px;text-align:center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2248/1987407668_a9de154a56_o.jpg" width="475" height="335" border="0" alt=""><small>[Images: <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/bannermans/index.htm">Bannerman's Island</a>, copyright <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/">Shaun O'Boyle</a>].</small><br><br>Don't miss the rest of O'Boyle's website, <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/ruins/index.htm"><i>Modern Ruins</i></a>, including his exquisite visual tour of Philadelphia's <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/esp/esp1-1.htm">Eastern State Penitentiary</a> &#8211; where my wife once worked as a tour guide &#8211; as well as this <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/crypt/pm1.htm">freaky crypt</a>.<br>Of course, you can also support the artist by <a href="http://www.oboylephoto.com/for_sale.htm">purchasing a print</a>. <br>Finally, you can read more about Bannerman's Island <a href="http://www.hudsonriver.com/bannerman.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannerman&#39;s_Castle">here</a> &#8211; and, while you're at it, why not read a bit about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldt_Castle">Boldt</a> <a href="http://www.boldtcastle.com/">Castle</a>, another ruined, island-bound mansion, this one standing amidst vegetation further north in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Islands">Thousand Islands</a>.
