<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>
As highlighted in <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mschwarz/archive/2006/02/03/437254.aspx">this post</a> on the Ajax.NET Professional blog today, there's a <a href="http://www.daniel-zeiss.de/AJAXComparison/Results.htm">comparison posted</a> of several of the popular Ajax frameworks for those working with ASP.NET (created by Daniel Zeiss).
</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>
First, let me explain why only these 6 Frameworks are included although there is a lot more AJAX stuff for ASP.NET out there. All the frameworks listed here have one unique AJAX feature: They allow updating page content without programming AJAX directly - i call it indirect AJAX programming - a compareable concept is called <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/hijax-graceful-degration">Hijax</a>.
</p>
	<p>
Therefore, frameworks that supply only controls with built in AJAX-features (Trees, Grids, Lists and so on...) are not included in the comparison. Please forgive me and drop me a note if I forgot a framework that also allows indirect AJAX programming.
</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
The list for <a href="http://www.daniel-zeiss.de/AJAXComparison/Results.htm">the comparison</a> includes:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>ComfortASP.NET V0.45 (beta)
</li>
	<li>MagicAJAX.NET V0.2.2
</li>
	<li>ComponentArt V3.0 Callback Control
</li>
	<li>and more...
</li>
</ul>
	
	<p>
He has very detailed charts covering different topics like general information about the package, it's ASP.NET compatibility, how much "traffic" it generates with its requests, and other additional features. There's even charts for the traffic (in bytes) for a few different tests he performs with each package.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>Today I interview Dave Javier, Producer/Lead Designer for AC at Turbine. I&#8217;m going to apologize in advance for this one. By running count, we had 5 seperate moments for hate mail in this interview (although one of them was Dave&#8217;s, so I can&#8217;t take ALL the blame!). We cover such amazingly important and relevant topics as North Korean Beef Jerky, Soul Caliber, The Almight Wez, (The Not Mighty) Wi, Porn, Guitar Hero, more Porn, and Jane&#8217;s Addiction.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to claim that I was under heavy&#8230; <em>something</em> during this interview. Medications, lack of sleep, insanity&#8230; Unfortunately, the best I can do is lay the blame entirely on Dave. So <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/n3/N3RDCast_20060206.mp3">tune in to hear Dave turn me into a complete raving lunatic</a>!

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'>Here are a few of my favorite (and the site's most popular) posts on that heated topic of email -- how to better deal with email as a recipient, and how to <em>improve</em> the lives of others as a better sender. Email is a subject that invigorates (and occasionally infuriates) me, so get ready for plenty more in the future. But if you're one of the seemingly innumerable people who's snowed under by email or unsure how to deal with it at a responsible level, flip through a few of these oldies, and see if any ideas jump  out at you.

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><div><p>Stats junkies: here&#39;s more data on the end of the hit-driven music economy. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/01/the_decade_the__1.html">posted</a> this chart on the number of Gold (over 500,000 sold), Platinum (1-2 million), Multi-Platinum (2-10
million) and Diamond (10 million and up) albums since 1958:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/hitalbums_1.jpg"><img width="449" height="356" border="0" alt="Hitalbums_1" title="Hitalbums_1" src="http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/images/hitalbums_1.jpg"></a>
</p>

<p>Many of you asked to see these numbers as a proportion of total music sales, to eliminate the distorting effect of the overall growth of the music industry over that period. I finally got good sales data for the pre-Soundscan (1993) period, so here you go, with a nice polynomial curve fit to highlight the trends <span style="color:#ff3300">[UPDATE: I&#39;ve clarified the Y axis units; it&#39;s hits/total $s]</span>:</p>

The <a href="http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp">RIAA database</a> this is drawn from is fascinating, and if I had more time I&#39;d be running more queries on trends in genre, sales velocity, and the changing breakdowns between gold, platinum and multiplatinum. But I don&#39;t, so I&#39;ll leave that as an exercise, as they say. If you do it and find something interesting, ping me and I&#39;ll link to it.</p></div></div></div></div><div class='row'>

	<p><b>moo.fx changelog:</b></p>
	<ul>
	<li>I've moved the animation logic, now you can use custom transitions (found in the bottom of both moo.fx and moo.fx.pack).</li>
	<li>Opacity effect has been modified, works better in safari and now you can call the setOpacity method to sudden set the opacity (crossbrowser) without displaying the effect.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>moo.fx.pack changelog:</b></p>
	<ul>
	<li>No more fx.FadeSize. use the new fx.Combo, supports any combination between height, width and opacity.</li>
	<li>No more fx.Multi. Use the new fx.Accordion, to generate accordions in 1 line of code!!</li>
	<li>No more parseClassNames (it was lame)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The main change is that there is <a href="http://moofx.mad4milk.net/documentation">documentation!</a></p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>There's nothing quite like the 8:00 AM meeting.</p>
<p>As soon as you see the invitation&#160;you know it&#39;s trouble.&#160; You&#39;ve missed these things before &#8212; the one morning you roll in at 9:30 is always the morning of an 8:00 AM meeting.&#160; So when you accept the invitation you take preventative action: you change the reminder from &quot;15 minutes&quot; to &quot;20 hours.&quot;&#160; You know that Future You will appreciate the heads-up.&#160; </p>
<p>The day before the meeting the reminder comes.&#160; You pat yourself on the back a little and set the reminder to &#8220;snooze&#8221; for an hour.&#160; After all, you are a moron, and you&#39;ll need hourly reminders for the rest of the day if you&#39;re to have any chance of making the 8:00 AM meeting.</p>
<p>The reminders continue popping up all day, so you actually remember to tell your wife, &quot;Hey, I have an 8:00 AM meeting tomorrow.&quot;&#160; This is a critical move on your part.&#160; Your wife is not nearly the moron you are, and she will remind you to set your alarm before going to sleep.&#160; (Nicely done.)</p>
<p>Later that evening, every decision you make considers the 8:00 AM meeting.&#160; Should we start this movie?&#160; What if it keeps us up too late?&#160; Should I eat this extra snack cake so I can skip breakfast in the morning?&#160; And why do we never have sex anymore?&#160; No seriously, why?</p>
<p>Morning comes, the alarm rings, and you press Snooze.&#160; At least you think you do.&#160; It&#39;s 50/50 that you actually turned the thing off.&#160; All you really know is that you successfully quieted the stupid thing.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes pass.&#160; Then ten more.&#160; You&#39;re dreaming now.&#160; You&#39;re on an island, perhaps, or in the mountains.&#160; Or maybe you&#39;re dreaming of a bed where people have sex at night.&#160; In any case, soon enough, a simple thought rips your dreamland apart: </p>
<p>8:00 AM MEETING!</p>
<p>Up like a bolt, you check the clock.&#160; [Expletive deleted!]&#160; You&#39;re late.&#160; You speed into the bathroom and become Economy of Motion Its Very Self.&#160; The shower is started, towels are thrown, clothes fall, and urine is dispensed.&#160; You will make up the lost time by multitasking!</p>
<p>&quot;No shaving today,&quot; you say as you step quickly into the shower.&#160; With this sentence you&#39;ve gained at least five minutes.&#160; Immediately, you soap up your face, and rinse.&#160; Other parts, and rinse.&#160; Some shampoo, and rinse. More soap, and rinse.&#160; </p>
<p><em>Golly, rinsing feels good.&#160; Very good.&#160; The water is warm, o</em><em>h so warm.&#160; My body is finally de-thawing from the bed.&#160; Aahhh, bed.&#160; We used to have fun in that bed&#8230;</em></p>
<p>8:00 AM MEETING!</p>
<p>You&#39;ve squandered the five minutes you saved from not shaving with unneeded rinsing.&#160; Idiot!&#160; So you kick into overdrive.&#160; One hand brushes teeth, while the other brushes hair.&#160; Shoes and socks are chosen by their proximity to your feet rather than their appropriateness with your attire.&#160; Lotion, of course, is summarily skipped.&#160; Lotion is a luxury for those without 8:00 AM meetings.</p>
<p>Miraculously, you make it to your car only a couple of minutes late.&#160; You know the commute well &#8212;&#160;if you can get just a tad lucky, maybe speed a little in a couple of spots, you can still make it.</p>
<p>Except you haven&#39;t factored in the rest of the planet, all of which is also trying to make it to work by 8:00 AM.&#160; (They must all have 8:00 AM meetings, or something.)&#160; Speeding and luck are no longer options.&#160; The roads are overflowing with cars and you&#39;re now hitting lights that you never, ever hit.</p>
<p>But you&#39;re an enterprising person &#8212; it takes more than a little traffic for you to give up.&#160; You decide that now is the time to explore an alternative route.&#160; These other cars are all driven by average people, lemmings.&#160; You can use your wit to beat them down the map.</p>
<p>So you turn.&#160; Only you don&#39;t really know any alternative routes.&#160; The road that looked promising is now curving, taking you AWAY from your office.&#160; And the road has no traffic whatsoever, which in hindsight, is probably not a good sign.&#160; After all, you&#39;re not THAT witty.</p>
<p>So now it&#39;s 8:00 AM and your car is parked on Farmer Jed&#39;s sprawling gravel drive.&#160; You have two choices: 1) Call the office and let them know you&#39;re &quot;en route,&quot; possibly throwing in a lame excuse about vomiting children, flat tires, or a complete lack of sex at nighttime.&#160; 2) Build a time machine.</p>
<p>Being somewhat witty, you build a time machine, enter it, and go back 20 minutes and make it to work in time.&#160; (Nicely done.)</p>
<p>You stroll into the office and, without breaking stride, drop your belongings at your desk on the way to the meeting room.&#160; The office is quiet, giving you a fleeting moment of peace.&#160; </p>
<p>You enter the meeting room proud.&#160; You&#39;re not annoyed by the traffic or the fact that someone called an 8:00 AM meeting.&#160; After all, you made it on time, and now you know how a time machine works.&#160; It&#39;s all good.&#160; </p>
<p>Except&#8230;</p>
<p>The meeting room is empty.&#160; Completely empty.&#160;&#160; No lights, paper, people, or projectors.&#160; &quot;Good thing I rushed,&quot; you think.&#160; Then, &quot;Slackers.&#160; Can&#39;t even make their own meeting.&quot;&#160; </p>
<p>You pick the best chair and try to look relaxed, as if you&#39;ve been there for hours.&#160; No one comes.&#160; You find a position that looks more relaxed, more confident.&#160; No one comes.&#160; You&#39;re now genuinely relaxed, even sleepy.&#160; No one comes.&#160; Now you look relaxed, sad, and lonely.&#160; Still, no one comes.</p>
<p>You return to your desk, press a button,&#160;and wait for your computer to do its thing.&#160; The office remains quiet.&#160; </p>
<p>A quick look in Outlook confirms your worst fear&#8230;</p>
<p>The meeting has been moved to 9:30.</p><img src="http://www.thelooneys.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=470" width="1" height="1"></div></div></div><div class='row'>

	<p>Yahoo! has just publicly launched two new (previously internal) libraries as well as a companion blog. Since Yahoo! has a lot of fantastic dhtml developers, this looks really promising. Do you want Yahoo! Mail? :)</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/yui/index.html">Yahoo! User Interface Library</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/index.php">Yahoo! Design Pattern Library</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://yuiblog.com/">Yahoo! User Interface Blog</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p><a href="http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/">Bill Scott</a> of Yahoo! told us about the news:</p>
	<blockquote><p>
<b>Yahoo! User Interface Library</b></p>
	<p>Since early in 2005, Yahoo! has been developing its own Ajax/DHTML framework. Core requirements for this library included excellent browser compatibility, industrial strength scalability and good documentation. The library is now available on the Yahoo! Developer Network under the BSD license! Its got all of the things you would expect (drag and drop, animation, event management, widgets, etc.)</p>
	<p><b>Yahoo! Design Pattern Library</b></p>
	<p>Since 2004, Yahoo! has been collecting and cataloging interaction design patterns in our internal Yahoo! Design Pattern Library. We have presented about it at conferences and in articles. But now we have opened it up for the public. This first release is small (just 13 patterns) but we will be adding to it over the next few months to round out the offerings in there.</p>
	<p>Notice we have rolled these two libraries out together. Today there is a small amount of synergy, but going forward we expect many of the design patterns to link directly to our code library for examples and help in implementing design solutions.</p>
	<p><b>Yahoo! User Interface Blog</b></p>
	<p>The <a href="http://yuiblog.com/">User Interface Blog is where will be talking about user interface design and development with these two libraries.<br>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p><a href="http://ajaxagent.org/">Ajax Agent</a> is another Ajax toolkit/library/framework created by some old Ajax pro&#39;s (the Lead Architect behind Onepage Portal Server (now Sybase Enterprise Portal) &amp; one of the core engineers behind the Content Express For Microsoft Commerce Server).</p>
	<p>Their aim is to make Ajax work as simple as possible.</p>
	<p>The PHP version offers three steps to get started with the framework:</p>
	<div>
<div>
	<div>
<span style="color:#616100">include_once</span><span style="color:#006600;font-weight:bold">(</span><span style="color:#ff0000">'agent.php'</span><span style="color:#006600;font-weight:bold">)</span>;<br>

&#160;</div>
	</div>
</div>
	<p>The first line is declared to include the AJAX Agent library, initialize the agent framework &amp; instantiate the server side &#39;Agent&#39;. The second line instantiates the client side &#39;Agent&#39;. The third line which runs on the client side within the javascript browser environment, uses the client side &#39;Agent&#39; to directly call the server function asynchronously. AJAX Agent supports complex data types like associated arrays &amp; objects. It makes use of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for data interchange format to achieve this.</p>

Over on SitePoint today, in the DHTML &amp; CSS blog section, Kevin Yank has <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/02/16/javascript-libraries-and-patterns-yahoo-does-ajax/">a new post</a> that talks about some of the Javascript libraries, including the new <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/yui/">Yahoo offerings</a>.
</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>
JavaScript is hard, but it could be a lot harder. These days, choosing your tools can actually be most of the work.
</p>
	<p>
Today, the poster children of web application success consist of numerous beefy and interdependent JavaScript files with a light dusting of HTML and CSS. With JavaScript codebases easily outweighing markup and style sheets, should most of the sensitive, new age web developer&#8217;s time be spent scripting?
</p>
	<p>
Well, unless you&#8217;re trying to solve a problem that no one has tackled before, the answer is &#8220;probably not.&#8221;
</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/02/16/javascript-libraries-and-patterns-yahoo-does-ajax/">The post</a> goes on to look at four of the more popular Javascript libraries out there - <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>, <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>, <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/community/ajaxtk_download.html">AjaxTK</a>, and, of course, the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/yui/">Yahoo UI Library</a>. There's a brief summary for each of them, focusing mainly on what it offers and where it fits into the Javascript community.
</p>
	<p>
He also finishes the post off with a brief look at design patterns in Javascript, specifically mentioning the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/">Yahoo design pattern library</a> they're now offering as well. There's links to some of the current patterns you'll find as well as some other references to get a hold of to read up on patterns themselves.

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p><img alt="monk.jpg" hspace="5" align="left" style="border:thin black solid" src="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/monk.jpg"> Reliable web game sensei JayIsGames has <a href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2006/02/monks_mind_game.php">put up a mini-review of the free 'Monk's Mind Game' Flash game</a>, a particularly neat web browser game find. </p>

<p>As Jay explains: "Monk is a detective with OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) in a <a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/series/monk/">show of the same name</a> on the USA network. To increase exposure for the show, and to generate traffic to the show's website, a new game has been launched that focuses on the trivial and repetitive tasks that Monk might face on a daily basis." </p>

<p>Turns out that "Monk's Mind game features 32 <a href="http://www.warioware.biz/">Wario Ware</a>-style mini-games that a player must complete, three (3) times of increasing difficulty, to win" - we particularly enjoy the cutlery straightening, but we were never cool in school, like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001724/">Tony Shalhoub</a>.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'>	<p>
The new site, <a href="http://www.digglicious.com/">Digglicious.com</a>, combines two of the most widely used/visited sites out there these days - Digg.com and Del.icio.us - to create a live feed showing a cross-reference for items coming from both sites, showing the diggs and the number of times tagged on del.icio.us together.
</p>
	<blockquote><p>
digg.com is a social news site and del.icio.us is a social bookmarking or tagging site. [Below] you can observe a live view of the action on these two sites without having to reload your browser. If a site interests you click on it to check it out, then return here and use the handy links to go directly to del.icio.us to bookmark it or digg.com to digg it!</p>
	<p>
The actual code that handles the updating is hand-written (no framework) and even uses its own functionality to do the fade-in at the top of the list. It's an interesting concept, and shows, once again, the power for bringing constant, current information that Ajax has to even the simplest apps.

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p><img alt="steinme.jpg" hspace="5" align="left" style="border:thin black solid" src="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/steinme.jpg"> We at GSW <a href="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2005/12/steinmeyer_popcap_in_casual_re_1.php">previously covered</a> Phil Steinmeyer's launch of his neeto casual PC title <a href="http://www.popcap.com/launchpage.php?theGame=bonniesbookstore">Bonnie's Bookstore</a> through the PopCap website, and now he's taking a distinctly unconventional step - <a href="http://www.philsteinmeyer.com/62/game-prototypes-tell-me-what-you-think/">posting a total of 16 playable PC prototypes</a> to get feedback on the best game ideas for his next title.</p>

<p>Steinmeyer is <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,4663/">formerly known for</a> his work on <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/tropico">Tropico</a> and <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/railroad-tycoon-ii">later versions</a> of the Railroad Tycoon series, and comments of this concept: "I&#8217;d really like to get solid feedback from a variety of folks, so I&#8217;m going public with these prototypes very early. They are crude prototypes, but hopefully show either the germ of something fun, or reveal an idea that frankly just doesn&#8217;t work."</p>

<p>There's actually a <a href="http://www.philsteinmeyer.com/files/prototypes.htm">specific download page</a> with more information on the prototypes, for which it's noted: "All games are variations on the basic color-matching puzzle paradigm that's used for most casual games.  But I think the mechanics of each game represent anywhere from moderate to major originality vis-a-vis currently popular match-3 games." This is a genuinely interesting and honest way to solicit feedback, and GSW thinks Mr. Steinmeyer should be applauded for his audacity.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>Has your Mac turned into a shooting gallery full of distractions? Do your eyes spin like pinballs every time you sit down to work? Try a few of these apps to help discourage attention-grabbers and force your sickeningly versatile computer (and <strong>yourself</strong>) into doing just one thing at a time.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<h3>Backdrop</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.johnhaney.com/backdrop/">http://www.johnhaney.com/backdrop/</a></p>

<p>Free - Designed as a way to create cleaner screengrabs, Backdrop simply throws up a fullscreen <em>backdrop</em> in the color of your choosing. Opening it and then switching to another app has the effect of &#8220;blacking out&#8221; everything on your screen but the foreground app. Practically the same as hitting &#8220;Hide Others&#8221; in most apps, but with the excellent added effect of also hiding that busy little Desktop of yours.</p>

<h3>MenuShade</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/">http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/</a></p>

<p>Free - Greatly dims the blaring whiteness of the Menu Bar at the top of your screen. Just mouse in to the menu anywhere and it brightens back up with a subtle &#8220;theater lighting&#8221; effect. Ostensibly there to prevent screen burn-in, I just love that it zaps out the <em>clock</em> and the million other widgets begging a mouse click when I&#8217;m at my most distractible.</p>

<h3>MacJournal</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.marinersoftware.com/sitepage.php?page=85">http://www.marinersoftware.com/sitepage.php?page=85</a></p>

<p>$24.95 - MacJournal is an okay writing app; frankly it doesn&#8217;t do anything for <em>me</em> that I&#8217;m not happier doing right in <a href="http://www.macromates.com/">TextMate</a> using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. But it does succeed in the one way Allan&#8217;s otherwise swell text editor cruelly refuses to help me: <em>it has an excellent full-screen mode</em>. This brilliantly, simply, effectively blots out everything in the world except for my own green letters on a plain black background. <em>Exquisite</em>. I bought it <em>just</em> for this feature and use it exclusively as a temporary typewriter, pasting into and copying back out into text files. Plenty of folks love this as their primary writing app, so you definitely don&#8217;t need my byzantine workflow to simply use and enjoy it. </p>

<h3>Saft</h3>

<p><a href="http://haoli.dnsalias.com/Saft/index.html">http://haoli.dnsalias.com/Saft/index.html</a></p>

<p>$12.00 - This wonderful Safari plug-in is just full of yummy features, but one of its coolest capabilties is a fantastic full-screen mode. With &#8220;Max Screen&#8221; (<code>cmd-shift-m</code>), I can maximize to the last available corner of my ~1.3 million pixels, showing nothing but chromeless web goodness. You might be amazed how much you can fit onto your screen when you really blow all the crap out of the way. And as distracting as the web can be when you&#8217;re working on something else, it&#8217;s really nice to <em>just</em> use a web browser if that&#8217;s what your work calls for at the moment.</p>

<h3>Dock</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">http://www.apple.com/macosx/</a></p>

<p>Free (part of OS X) - Hit &#8220;Turn Hiding On&#8221; to sweep the Dock out of constant view, appearing only on mouse entry. I find this  decreases my distractibility by a factor of five. While the Dock can sure be handy for dragging stuff around and getting &#8220;at-a-glance&#8221; status updates,  it&#8217;s also the ultimate attractive nuisance &#8212; a colorful candy store full of things you don&#8217;t  really need to be thinking about just now. Kill it the second you get busy. Then just bring it back later when you&#8217;re done. Easiest thing in the world.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>What&#8217;s your favorite distraction killer for OS X?</em></p>

<hr>

<p><small>Yes, Grasshopper, your second semester &#8220;zen&#8221; meta-observations about &#8220;shutting off the router&#8221; will be suffered with a game half-smile, but I&#8217;m <em>really</em> more interested in <strong>OS X software</strong> for this particular thread, so please do try to stay on topic. What are the Mac applications, control panels, haxies, and other downloadables that can help us regrettable louts who still wander in ignorance and distraction?</small></p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>A favorite topic of <a href="http://gtd.43folders.com/" title="">GTD</a>&#8216;ers is the <em>contexts</em> that we each choose to identify the times, tools, or locations by which a given task can or must be undertaken. This is a highly personalized decision, and I&#8217;ve learned a lot from seeing how other people are doing it. </p>

<p>Since I see it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve talked about how I&#8217;m using contexts, here&#8217;s an update that reflects  how I&#8217;m now using <a href="http://www.kinkless.com/">Kinkless GTD</a> and iCal to keep things wrangled.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<h3>Contexts, enumerated</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning that a lot of my approach has been shaped by my move from Entourage to kGTD + iCal. While the actual contexts haven&#8217;t changed too much, the way I organize and think about them has evolved, as we&#8217;ll see a bit later. </p>

<p>The context themselves, with a brief explanation, where it&#8217;s useful or non-obvious:</p>

<h4>Actionable contexts</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>brainstorm</strong></li>
<li><strong>calls</strong></li>
<li><strong>chores</strong></li>
<li><strong>decide</strong></li>
<li><strong>design &amp; code</strong> - stuff that usually involves opening a text editor or Photoshop. I try to keep these kind of activities &#8220;ganged&#8221; together. (<a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/02/01/ganging-tasks/">See also</a>)</li>
<li><strong>desk</strong> - Usu. stuff like backups, filing, or paperwork, where I need to actually be at my desk or office in general</li>
<li><strong>email</strong> - Can be writing, reading, processing, or any task that starts with my email app</li>
<li><strong>errands</strong></li>
<li><strong>google</strong> - Yep. It earns its own context. I do use it that much.</li>
<li><strong>mac anyplace</strong> - Anything that requires Mac work but not internet connectivity. Mostly administrative.</li>
<li><strong>monitoring</strong> - a more active version of &#8220;waiting on&#8221; &#8212; when I really need something and am, say, watching a page for updates or leaning on a late delivery</li>
<li><strong>print</strong></li>
<li><strong>refactor</strong> - This is a new one. When I find an item isn&#8217;t getting done &#8212; for whatever reason &#8212; I tell myself to go back later and refactor it (<a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/27/does-this-next-action-belong-someplace-else/">see also</a>)</li>
<li><strong>read</strong></li>
<li><strong>schedule</strong> - Something tentatively planned that hasn&#8217;t been nailed down yet. Also RSVPs I owe people.</li>
<li><strong>web</strong> </li>
<li><strong>write</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>Unactionable or deferred contexts</h4>

<p>(Note: the &#8220;+&#8221; sign tells kGTD that these contexts don&#8217;t generate next actions or iCal syncs)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>agenda +</strong></li>
<li><strong>cogitate +</strong> - Stuff I&#8217;m just percolating on for a while.</li>
<li><strong>delivery +</strong> - Mmmmm&#8230;.FedEx.</li>
<li><strong>fallow project +</strong> - This is a weird context I use to mark projects that are dead or on-hold (it actually will be obviated by a feature in the next version of kGTD)</li>
<li><strong>later-maybe +</strong> </li>
<li><strong>not-yet +</strong> - If I want to take an action out of the queue for a while, I change it to &#8220;not-yet&#8221; from its active context. Accumulating too many of these is lazy, so I frequently shunt them off into a project support file. </li>
<li><strong>opportunities +</strong> - Speaking, writing gigs, possible interviews, etc. This is similar to &#8220;sales leads&#8221; I guess. Just stuff I&#8217;ve been asked to do in a non-specific way, and that I want to keep track of. </li>
<li><strong>projects-next +</strong> - Similar to &#8220;not-yet,&#8221; I sometimes use this as a placeholder for something that&#8217;s about to start, and that I don&#8217;t want to lose track of when looking at what&#8217;s on my plate.</li>
<li><strong>waiting-on +</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>So, that&#8217;s a snapshot of where I am now. A number of those contexts are &#8220;on the bubble&#8221; right now &#8212; too cute or fussy or potentially procrastinatable <small>(is that even a word?)</small>. I comb through contexts in general every few weeks, or more often when one of them seems to have become an oubliette for the items I want to banish from thought. That&#8217;s a good sign that the context is not about <em>action</em> at all and should be removed or refactored immediately.</p>

<h3>iCal Groups</h3>

<p>And now: <em>the sexy</em>.</p>

<p>iCal sucks in a lot of ways (that&#8217;s for another post), but it does do one thing I love: it let&#8217;s you put your separate &#8220;calendars&#8221; &#8212; which, in our case, are the actionable contexts we&#8217;ve synced from kGTD &#8212; into &#8220;groups.&#8221; I&#8217;m using this to make three &#8220;meta-contexts&#8221; that mirror the very general types of work into which all my tasks (and their parent contexts) belong.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Real World</strong> - Primarily physical or location-based stuff (esentially: &#8220;non-computer&#8221; contexts)</li>
<li><strong>Think</strong> - Brain work, decision-making, and creative stuff &#8212; which usually occurs in the proximity of a Mac, but absolutely does not have to.</li>
<li><strong>Compute</strong> - Tasks that by their nature require direct computer interaction: this is the &#8220;@computer&#8221; uber-category</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.43folders.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/Compute%20contexts.thumbnail.png" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="8">But why bother with organizing these into meta-groups? Ah, because it makes it <em>so easy</em> to reveal or hide all the tasks that I can work on at a given time, just by ticking the group&#8217;s little click box. This makes having many contexts <strong>so</strong> much more manageable. So, if you&#8217;re keeping score, here&#8217;s how they break out in iCal </p>

<ul>
<li>Real World
<ul><li>errands</li>
<li>chores</li>
<li>calls</li>
<li>read</li></ul></li>
<li>Think
<ul><li>brainstorm</li>
<li>decide</li>
<li>research</li>
<li>schedule</li>
<li>write</li></ul></li>
<li>Compute
<ul><li>desk</li>
<li>design &amp; code</li>
<li>email</li>
<li>google</li>
<li>mac anyplace</li>
<li>print</li>
<li>web</li>
<li>monitoring</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Which gets me to the secret point of this post. It&#8217;s the basic kGTD approach that&#8217;s been really useful to me: </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Use kGTD to <em>collect</em>, <em>process</em>, <em>organize</em>, and <em>review</em>  </li>
  <li>Use iCal to <strong>do</strong></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This has the effect of keeping you really focused on the <em>doing</em> rather than the fiddling. Once you&#8217;ve got kGTD set up to a point where you trust it to mind your world, try <em>living</em> in iCal instead. For one thing it&#8217;s a lot less engrossing to play with, which might send you back to work more quickly than the amusement park ride that kGTD can be. You end up with a shorthand way to mentally gauge your &#8220;doing-to-fiddling ratio&#8221;; If you find you are spending a lot more time in kGTD than iCal you know it&#8217;s time to ramp up the working and dial down the fussy meta work.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'>
        <p>Spring is coming, and with the return of baseball and the chirping of young birds in the air, a young man's thoughts turn to... Internet standards.</p>

<p>As in years past, there are a number of new conversations going on around standards, some old and some new. For example, <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2006/02/submitting_trac.html">you can help make TrackBack a standard</a>. Isn't that cool?</p>

<p>I'm really glad to see that an effort we've been working on for some time is finally seeing some light: TrackBack is being opened up to be governed by the community, and the <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2006/02/trackback_worki.html">initial response</a> seems very positive.</p>

<p>The way I've learned about standardization efforts, especially in the weblog tools community, is from the history of <span>RSS </span>and Atom. Here's the key lessons I've taken from that experience:</p>


<ul>
<li>Users shouldn't have to know or care about this stuff.</li>
<li>Being able to point to real-world benefits is important.</li>
<li>Technologists sometimes have (enormous) egos, which extend to the belief that being good at technology makes one good at marketing, public relations, or interpersonal relations.</li>
<li>Shipping an implementation pretty much trumps everything else. Most technical debates are eventually settled by looking at what is in current use. Sometimes this is phrased as "letting the market decide".</li>
<li>There are a number of different communities of users and developers. Enterprise users and developers on platforms like .NET and Java often like more tightly-defined "correct" specs, and users and developers in the <span>LAMP </span>world often like more ad-hoc specs that are more human-readable. And non-technical users will frustrate both camps by being completely irrational in regard to specs.</li>
<li>There's plenty of exceptions to that rule about de facto vs. de jure standards, but both audiences have trouble seeing the value of the other camp's preferences. You gotta have a Martin, and you gotta have a Malcolm.</li>
<li>Some really quiet, helpful people will do really hard, thankless work and not expect any kind of reward. I am constantly amazed by this.</li>
<li>"Better" and "open" are generally terms so vague as to be meaningless. People who are against these things are generally against motherhood and freedom.</li>
<li>Personal attacks should automatically get the attacker put on everyone's kill file, even if they're accurate. This doesn't usually happen.</li>
<li>Sometimes the person making the personal attacks is the person doing the thankless work. I suspect there's a correlation here.</li>
<li>Criticisms of technologies are often wrongly interpreted as personal attacks by those technologies' creators.</li>
<li>There's more than one way to do it.</li>
</ul>



<p>Anyway, there's lots more lessons to be learned, but I'd love to see if people have any feedback on these points. If you don't care about standardization, congratulations! You're a Normal User.</p>
