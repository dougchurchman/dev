Alex Bosworth describes, in <a href="http://www.sourcelabs.com/blogs/ajb/2006/03/ajax_and_xslt_in_web_developme.html">this blog post</a>, a simple example that he's created to show the possibilities of merging XSLT with Ajax to create a "skinning" site for prettying-up blog RSS feeds.
</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>
I've been looking a lot lately at what XSLT can add to web development, and this weekend I started playing around with Google's <a href="http://swik.net/AjaXSLT">AjaXSLT</a> project.
</p>
	<p>
I'm not that much of an XSLT expert, so to get started I coded up a simple project to generate XSLT templates for RSS feeds, called "<a href="http://sandbox.sourcelabs.com/skinnerbox">Skinnerbox</a>".
</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
He <a href="http://www.sourcelabs.com/blogs/ajb/2006/03/ajax_and_xslt_in_web_developme.html">briefly describes</a> his process, mentioning some of the difficulties that he's had with Javascript along the way (its slowness). His suggestion is that working with XSLT in Javascript and filtering some of the content that needs to be handled can really help speed things up.
</p>
	<p>
The app he's created, <a href="http://sandbox.sourcelabs.com/skinnerbox">Skinnerbox</a>, takes in the URL of a blog (or other site) feed, pulls it in, and, based on some input from the user (an optional note at the top and the option of creating quick and easy subscribe buttons)  outputs a "pretty" version of the feed. You can get all of the details on this sample application from it's <a href="http://swik.net/Skinnerbox">Wiki page</a>.

Take a look at Dennis Rice&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gottabemobile.com/MindJetMindManagerInkshow.aspx">cool demo of Mind Manager</a>, James Kendrick&#8217;s <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkotr_audio_edition/2006/02/jkontherun_audi.html">awesome TabletPC video</a>, or Rob Bushway&#8217;s production <a href="http://www.gottabemobile.com/ActiveWordsTEOSoftShow.aspx">starring the duo of Active Words and TEO</a> if you haven&#8217;t already seen these &#8220;best in class&#8221; &#8216;casts. Never one to be outdone, I cobbled a little method to do something similar on a different type of mobile device: my Windows Mobile 5.0 XV6700 phone. As a first cut, you can view and listen to what I call &#8220;<a href="http://www.kevintwodotoh.com/screencasts/MSVC_60_sec.wmv">Microsoft Voice Command in under 60 seconds</a>&#8220;. Voice Command can do so much for mobile users, so I only scratch the surface, but I think you&#8217;ll get the idea in less than a minute. Prior to speaking a command, you do have to hit a hardware button so that Voice Command knows it should be listening; that&#8217;s the little &#8220;notification noise&#8221; you&#8217;ll hear after I press the button. Shoot me your feedback if you want to see more of these on a Windows Mobile 5.0 device or I guess I can follow the crowd and do some TabletPC demos as well. <img src="http://kevintwodotoh.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)">  Hey, can I help it if I&#8217;m a trend-setter?</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>Some of the activity this week at our internal 37signals <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com">Campfire</a> chat room:</p>

<p>David said guiding his parents remotely through an isight &#8220;is the most infuriating experience ever. I have immense respect for anyone who can work a computer hotline. I was ready for suicide a few times. but its also an interesting experience just how much we take for granted.&#8221; Marcel said, &#8220;it used to make me soooo frustrated to have to guide my parents to do stuff on their computer. i had to resort to the most basic instruction set. i couldn&#8217;t say &#8216;browser&#8217; or &#8216;close your browser&#8217;&#8230;i would have to say, &#8216;in the top right corner of that big rectangle on your screen, there are three buttons, one of which is red.&#8217;&#8221; Jason chimed in: &#8220;My parents call windows &#8216;squares&#8217; which made it REALLY confusing for me the first time I tried to help them and buttons are &#8216;ovals&#8217; or &#8216;things.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Wise Ryan gave Marcel some advice on dealing with needy support requesters: &#8220;one trick with people who keep writing you is to get shorter and shorter with your response&#8230;they feed on the energy they get back from you&#8221; He also told me that sometimes it&#8217;s better not to explain decisions: &#8220;when you give people a reason, the next thing they do is come up with why that reason isn&#8217;t good, or how to get around it, ad nauseum&#8230;until finally you say &#8216;listen, we really don&#8217;t care about that right now, ok?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37s/113829355/" title="Photo Sharing">This photo of Jason, David, and Ryan from Businessweek</a> drew some fire from Marcel: &#8220;ryan is looking <em>through</em> the camera into its soul&#8230;little known fact: jason&#8217;s parents trained him gruelingly from a young age with those face muscle excerising videos so he&#8217;d grow up to one day have a killer million dollar smile&#8230;ryan&#8217;s parents, on the other hand, made him read Schopenhauer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jason pondered why companies with lots of VC cash still churn out bad designs and said, &#8220;Money can buy talent but it can&#8217;t buy you passion, motivation, or curiosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>David is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37s/116420804/" title="Photo Sharing">The Hottest Hacker on Earth</a> according to Wired which is &#8220;fucking hilariously awesome&#8221; according to Marcel. Jason loved the Wired piece but doesn&#8217;t understand why Wired hasn&#8217;t done a huge piece on Rails yet. David&#8217;s response: &#8220;Give them 6 months ;)&#8221; Meanwhile, David said he&#8217;s gearing up for his next career as a Gap model. Marcel responded, &#8220;Now excuse me while i go rent out some warehouse space near the office for your ego&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcel: &#8220;btw, oranges are awesome. beautiful and delicious. let&#8217;s make something as beautiful and delicious as an orange.&#8221;</p>

<p>We know someone (who wishes to remain unnamed) that had a meeting with a VC guy last week. The VC dude actually said this sentence: &#8220;My goal wants to be to help you accelerate what your strategic intent is.&#8221;</p>
<p>We discussed <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=goog">Google&#8217;s new finance site</a>. Some comments: &#8220;i think it&#8217;s cool how they linked the news articles with the graph.&#8221; &#8220;What I like about it is that you can just enter a company name in the box. you don&#8217;t need to know the stock symbol. took like 10 years to get that. amazing.&#8221; &#8220;i like how when you scroll the graph, the news story section auto scrolls too&#8230;also, the rollovers in the Management section are nice.&#8221; And we wish good luck to these Google moderators: &#8220;It will also link to discussions on Web logs about specific companies. The service will offer its own bulletin-board discussions on financial topics. The boards will be moderated by a new group of Google employees hired to ensure the quality of the discussions&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>We received this nice letter:</p>

<blockquote>I wanted to drop a note to let you know that you&#8217;re doing good work and helping your users produce measurable results.<br><br>

In October I started a new position as a UI designer. Like many new hires, I
was eager to make a good first impression on my boss and my colleagues.
After much reading about Basecamp, I signed up for the free level. As my
responsibilities ballooned, I quickly landed on the $24 / month plan.<br><br>

My six month review was last week, and I received a 10% raise, plus some
other company-specific rewards. Without Basecamp, there is NO WAY I could
have kept up the pace and performed as well at such a consistent manner.
Needless to say, the $144 I&#8217;ve paid for Basecamp has paid for itself.</blockquote>

<p>Someone started <a href="http://basecamphq.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1717">a Basecamp forum called &#8220;Why Doesn&#8217;t the API have Feature xxx??? I need xxx!&#8221;</a> in order to &#8220;get the ball rolling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcel and David are excited for <a href="http://dabbledb.com/utr/?">Dabble (video)</a>. Jason thinks Dabble looks nice in the demo but thinks the UI is messy and confusing (&#8220;the UI just feels really heavy &#8212; more chrome than data&#8221;). David says general DB software has to be complex to a certain degree.</p>

<p>We find this screen at <a href="http://tracker.jot.com/example_uses/">jot.com</a> rather similar to <a href="http://www.writeboard.com/examples/">this screen</a> at the Writeboard site.</p>

<p>Jason (who went to school in Tuscon): &#8220;man, listening to Calexico takes me back to AZ&#8221; Marcel: &#8220;yeah&#8230;always makes me feel like i&#8217;m driving down a desert highway at sunset&#8230;remote and eerie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jason and Jamis dig <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065CE7/103-9393935-4506217?v=glance&amp;n=228013">laser levels</a>. Marcel and I like it when you just get to use the nails left by old tenants.</p>

<p>You hear weird things on TV. Marcel heard this on a Dish network ad: &#8220;Nothing is worse than paying too much for television&#8221;.  Sure, the war in Iraq, the genocide in Darfur, and the destruction of Katrina may be bad&#8230;but <em>nothing</em> is worse than paying too much for television. Also: &#8220;I know you. You have rheumatoid arthritis&#8221; is the first line in an ad I saw for some prescription drug. Whoa, I had no idea. I am now considering moving to Florida.</p>

<p>Jason changed the room&#8217;s quote/topic to: &#8220;You can accomplish anything you want in life provided you don&#8217;t mind who gets the credit.&#8221; -Harry S Truman</p>

<p>Sam uploaded <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37s/116803163/" title="Photo Sharing">this &#8220;People-ready?&#8221; image</a> and said, &#8220;it&#8217;s the &#8216;FIND OUT&#8217; that makes me laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jamis is hooked on cadbury cream eggs&#8230;&#8221;it&#8217;s a good thing they only come out once a year.&#8221; Ryan: &#8220;those are evil.&#8221; Jamis: &#8220;evil is an understatement.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ryan prefers discussions that focus around &#8220;what Could be versus what Should be&#8230;people making suggestions always say what SHOULD be done instead of what COULD be done&#8230;it&#8217;s also good within teams as well to show possibilities and options instead of stomping the foot about necessities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mitch Hedberg and Stephen Wright jokes made the rounds:</p>

<blockquote>MH: I mumble a lot on stage, I&#8217;m a mumblerer. But sometimes what I mumble is some insignificant shit. Like I&#8217;ll be walking down the street with my friend, and I will have said something, but he didn&#8217;t hear me, so he says &#8220;What!?&#8221; SO I&#8217;ll say it again, and again he had not heard me, so he&#8217;d say, &#8220;What!?&#8221; And now by this time I am yelling &#8220;That tree is very far away!&#8221;<br><br>

MH: My friend asked me if I wanted a frozen bananna, and I said NO, but I&#8217;m gonna want a regular bananna later, so YEAH.<br><br>

SW: I have a hobby&#8230;I have the world&#8217;s largest collection of sea shells. I keep it scattered on beaches all over the world. Maybe you&#8217;ve seen some of it&#8230;<br><br>

SW: I went down the street to the 24-hour grocery. When I got there, the guy was locking the front door. I said, &#8220;Hey, the sign says you&#8217;re open 24 hours.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, but not in a row.&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>Jason on home renovations: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got this little old polish guy here doing some work. dude is probably like 60, built like a tank. and he&#8217;s working with this mexican guy. they don&#8217;t speak each other&#8217;s language. and they call each other by their homeland. &#8216;Poland, can you&#8230;&#8217; and &#8216;Mexico, will you&#8230;&#8217; Jamis responded, &#8220;haha, agile :)&#8221;</p>

<p>Tim O&#8217;Reilley was on stage with Bill Gates this week and <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/03/onstage_with_bill_gates_at_mix.html">37signals was part of one of Tim&#8217;s questions</a>. Alas, when question time came, 37signals wasn&#8217;t actually mentioned.</p>

<p>Marcel reported there have been over half a million text messages on campfire so far and over 1 million total messages.</p>

<p>Jason noted <a href="http://munjal.typepad.com/recognizing_deven/2006/01/going_to_the_mo.html">this blog post about Riya</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Now back to the hard work to building a company. BTW we need to hire some absolute rockstars in Business Development, Finance (a Controller to mind the money), a Revenue Manager (CPC Advertising expert - if you have to ask what CPC is don&#8217;t apply&#8230;;-), and a few additional researchers for our super smart Riya Labs which is now (unconfirmed) the largest team of computer vision Ph.Ds in any single company in the country.</blockquote>

<p>Jason&#8217;s response: &#8220;OH GAWD&#8230;See what VC does to you? We <em>need</em> to hire Biz Dev, &#8220;Revenue Manager&#8221; &#8220;Controller&#8221; ;) unless that&#8217;s a joke. I can&#8217;t tell anymore.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think it was a joke.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nypost.com/img/front032106.gif">Trump baby NY Post cover</a> made me laugh out loud.</p>

<p>File upload limits were discussed and a simple solution was figured out&#8230;<br>
Ryan: what are we trying to avoid with a limit? won&#8217;t a gigantic file just time out anyway?<br>
Jason: thats&#8217; the problem. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t my file transfer work?&#8221; &#8220;What happened to the file I uploaded&#8221; &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t the upload finish?&#8221;<br>
Ryan: less software idea..we could just say there&#8217;s a limit. and then if people try something bigger and it works, then good for them<br>
Jason: I like that best. done.</p>

<p>Ryan changed the room&#8217;s topic to &#8220;Most of the wonderful places in the world were not made by architects but by the people.&#8221; -Christopher Alexander</p>

<p>Jason loves this quote: &#8220;The Universe is difficult to comprehend because it is obvious&#8221; -Albert Einstein</p>

<p>Jamis: &#8220;so, I&#8217;ve been reading Winnie the Pooh to my son at naptime, and came across this gem today (from Chapter 8 of &#8216;The House at Pooh Corner&#8217;)&#8230;Winnie the Pooh was written as much for adults to read as kids, I think :)&#8221;&#8230;<br>
&#8220;Rabbit&#8217;s clever,&#8221; said Pooh thoughtfully.<br>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Piglet, &#8220;Rabbit&#8217;s clever.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;And he has Brain.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Piglet. &#8220;Rabbit has Brain.&#8221;<br>
There was a long silence.<br>
&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Pooh, &#8220;that that&#8217;s why he never understands anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcel offered these <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37s/116815763/" title="Photo Sharing">expressionistic</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37s/116815753/" title="Photo Sharing">representations</a> of what it&#8217;s like to wade through support email.</p>

<p>Finally, there was a completely ridiculous conversation where Jason admitted to ordering a BB gun to hunt rats in his backyard. &#8220;They hang really close until I come near so I can hit them from my second floor window and they&#8217;ll never know what hit them. I ordered an orange hat too.&#8221; We also discussed the remarkable traits of rats (Ryan: &#8220;if the scientists ever cross a rat and an octopus, we&#8217;re screwed.&#8221;). Btw, Jason&#8217;s first attempt was throwing boiling water at the rats. &#8220;That didn&#8217;t work&#8230;that was stupid,&#8221; according to Jason. He will report back next week when the gun arrives and said he &#8220;may stuff the rat head and hang it on my wall.&#8221; We eagerly anticipate further reports from Elmer, er, Jason.</p>

<br>All I&#39;m saying is  - I see Yahoo!&#39;s secret plan now.  &quot;<em>We&#39;ll keep posting mind-blowing, well-choreographed amateur lightsaber duels until they&#39;re too distracted to code.</em>&quot;  I can sadly confirm that this is pretty much an excellent plan.</div></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><div>On our way to other things the <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> team decided to open up sharing of labels.  Basically you can have a page in Reader that will splice together feeds you choose.  Or it can splice just single posts or entries that you <strike>tag</strike>, er, <em>label</em>.  That page also has a feed.  There are a number of really interesting ways to use it, I think.<h3>Clips</h3>With sharing in Reader you can put a clip of items anywhere you control HTML.  They can use a theme or have styles applied via CSS.  The clip feature is popular.  Some examples:<br>

<h3>Starred items</h3>You can also have a &quot;starred items&quot; page to show stuff you want to share with someone (or with everyone).  <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/user/07612027119295739225/state/com.google/starred">Here&#39;s my starred items</a>.<h3>All about &quot;you&quot;</h3>Another use I&#39;ve been thinking of for shared Reader information is as additional profile data.  I&#39;ve styled a couple of Reader clips to show my recent recommendation and reading data on <a href="http://massless.org/?area=About">the about page for this blog</a>.<br>
<br>Then there&#39;s my <em>Me Roll</em>.   Feed services like ours owe a lot from others&#39; pioneering of these uses (e.g. Feedburner&#39;s) and I&#39;ve found using splicing for this kind of avatar-as-feed has been immediately gratifying.  I am considering pointing my auto-discovery link to the feed for <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/user/07612027119295739225/label/me">my &quot;me&quot; label</a> instead of this blog&#39;s feed.    There&#39;s a steadily increasing amount of feed-serving out there so features like this help push the barrier to splicing nice and low.  I&#39;m not entirely sure what belongs in a &quot;me&quot; feed, however.  Flickr photos, sure.  My moblog, yup.  My normal blog, of course.  But what about the comments feed on my Flickr photos?  My del.icio.us feed?  My upcoming.org feed?  Hmm.<br>
<br>Oh, and &quot;me roll&quot;?  <a href="http://xenomachina.com/">Laurence</a> coined that term and he&#39;s immensely proud of it since it&#39;s his favorite phrase ever and he claimed that people would build cities around it and has monogrammed it onto all of his v-neck cardigan sweaters which is his favorite type of clothing.  (Entire sentence after &quot;that term&quot; is a lie.)<br>
<br>What should we call a &quot;me&quot; feed?<h3>Some technical notes</h3>For the Javascript-adept it might be interesting to note that we&#39;re delivering clips in Douglas Crockford&#39;s <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON format</a> and using callback wrapping to work around the same-origin policy which hampers similar efforts via the XmlHttpRequest object.  (It should just be named HttpRequest, shouldn&#39;t it true believers?)  Want more information about it?  Check out the <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/12/16/json">writeup by Simon Willison</a> about the excellent Yahoo! APIs which have JSON as an alternative output format.<br>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>Today we officially introduce the initial release of the <a href="http://basecamphq.com/api/">Basecamp API</a> (implemented as vanilla XML over HTTP). The API allows programmers to access/read/write Basecamp data from third-party systems like OS X dashboard widgets, Yahoo/Confabulator widgets, web sites, back-office systems, billing systems, other web-based/desktop products, and more.</p>

<p>The API is available to all Basecamp customers &#8212; from the free 1-project plan to the Premium plan. To enable it for your account, log into your Basecamp site, click the Account tab, and scroll down to the API section.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve set up <a href="http://basecamphq.com/forum/viewforum.php?id=6">a forum for the API</a> so developers can share tips, tricks, and help one another implement apps that use the Basecamp API.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re very excited to see what the world does with the API. We&#8217;ll continue to improve the API and open up more of Basecamp to the API in the next few weeks and months. We&#8217;ll also be posting example uses and implementations for everyone to check out.</p>

<p>Thanks again for everyone&#8217;s feedback and patience so far. We know the API has been a long time coming. We hope it was worth the wait.</p>

<p>The wait is over, kids. Ethan Schoonover has just released his .83 version of <a href="http://www.kinkless.com/">Kinkless GTD</a>, and, brother, does it ever bring it. <small>(For an intro to what kGTD <em>is</em>, start <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/04/review-kinkless-gtd-for-automated-elegant-os-x-task-management/" title="">here</a>, then go <a href="http://www.43folders.com/category/kgtd/">here</a> and of course, <a href="http://www.kinkless.com/" title="">here</a>.)</small></p>

<p>So, first great thing: the syncing problems people (including me) were having &#8212; getting changes in Action views and iCal to get reflected correctly back in Projects view &#8212; has been fixed most elegantly. So it&#8217;s just a lot more usable and dependable right out of the box. But that ain&#8217;t all E&#8217;s been cooking up. Among the trove of new and updated features (cribbed from Ethan):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Everything syncs: all changes to all columns are now synchronized across all views of a task (Projects/Actions/iCal)</li>
  <li>Deletions now handled with the good old delete key on your keyboard</li>
  <li>Singleton tasks section, now a full citizen</li>
  <li>Better QS action&#8230; and fancy &#8220;task shorthand&#8221; to make it easy to send a task to a specific context/project</li>
  <li>Task aging</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Ethan, as ever, has done a terrific <a href="http://kinkless.com/files/videos/kgtd_intro.mov">screencast</a> explaining how the app works &#8212;  <strong>DO NOT MISS</strong>  the video if you aren&#8217;t &#8220;getting&#8221; kGTD, because it&#8217;s super useful in showing exactly how it works &#8212; plus I&#8217;m <em>sure</em> there will be lots of lively discussion over on <a href="http://www.kinkless.com/kgtd/forum">the kGTD forum</a>, so for today I&#8217;ll just focus on my favorite improved feature: what Ethan calls &#8220;fancy &#8220;task shorthand.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<h3>Previously</h3>

<p>In the previous release (.7) there was some amazing stuff in kGTD that had helped realign the way I think about doing GTD on a Mac. Kinkless made it easy to <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/11/04/kgtd-keeps-getting-better/">add items to an inbox</a> via <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>, and the excellent iCal integration allowed me to <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/02/27/contexts/">organize my contexts</a> in very efficient and functional ways. Which, by themselves, would have allowed me to die happy.</p>

<p>But in this latest release, Ethan takes it further <small>(yes! yet! again!)</small> by introducing a simple syntax for taking tasks beyond the inbox &#8212; allowing you to create actions via both Quicksilver <em>and</em> iCal that are then placed into the correct project <strong>and</strong> context back in kGTD. Total round-trip, no-look task management. So let&#8217;s look at some examples of how it actually works in practice.</p>

<p>Once everything is properly installed, we start to add an action via Quicksilver, and everything works pretty much as before. I bring up QS, type to select &#8220;KGTD Inbox,&#8221; tab to the second pane and select &#8220;Process Text,&#8221; then tab to the third pane, and enter my new task via the Text Mode field. (Note, as ever, that you can make a Trigger in QS that reduces all but the actual typing into a one-click operation).</p>

<h3>The new syntax</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/merlin/118824245/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/51/118824245_8ad7b5d719_m.jpg" width="240" height="155" alt="kGTD - Quicksilver task with Projec and Context" align="right" border="0" hspace="15" vspace="5"></a>Back in .7, you could type in, say &#8220;<code>Call doctor about my crabs</code>&#8221; and your dolorous little task would be deposited neatly back in your kGTD Inbox for further processing later on. Which was great. But, in .8, let&#8217;s say you instead typed in something like &#8220;<code>Call doctor about my crabs &gt; Health Initiative @ phonecalls</code>&#8220;.</p>

<p>Well, if you already have a kGTD project called &#8220;<code>Health Initiative</code>&#8221; and a context titled &#8220;<code>phonecalls</code>,&#8221; then you just added a new item to that project with that context; on sync, the action will populated into your &#8220;phonecalls&#8221; list in kGTD plus, if you&#8217;re doing iCal syncing, it will be added to your &#8220;phonecalls&#8221; calendar. This is, as you can imagine, pretty insanely useful. So if you didn&#8217;t catch that exactly, in this syntax &#8220;<code>&gt;</code>&#8221; precedes the name of a <em>project</em> and &#8220;<code>@</code>&#8221; precedes the name of a <em>context</em>; Quicksilver and kGTD take care of the rest of the heavy lifting. But wait, there&#8217;s more.</p>

<h3>It&#8217;s smart, this syntax</h3>

<p>You could also have entered that same item as &#8220;<code>Call doctor about my crabs &gt; Hea @ phon</code>&#8221; since kGTD only needs the <em>beginning</em> of a string to create a match. Note that in cases of multiple matches, it just goes to the first project or context it finds (this can be helped a lot by smart, unique naming of projects and contexts). </p>

<p>Or, let&#8217;s say you did not yet have a top-level project for this particular action and wanted to create one. You might then type &#8220;<code>Call doctor about my crabs &gt; new @ phonecalls</code>&#8221; and have kGTD automagically add the task in a new project called &#8220;<code>new</code>,&#8221; that you can then edit later on back in your document.</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s say you wanted to, for example, do some research on these crabs and want to capture a web address for future reference. No problem. Consider&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visit website about crabs &gt; Health Initiative @ web <code>[line break]</code>
  http://www.YouveGotCrabs.com/</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8230;where the line break in the QS text field is achieved via <code>option-return</code>.</p>

<p>When you pop back over to kGTD, you&#8217;ll be pleased to see that the address of your crab portal has been neatly placed in the &#8220;notes&#8221; field of your new task. Click on it, and you&#8217;re taken right to the site.</p>

<h3>iCal wants to play, too</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/merlin/118824244/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/40/118824244_13f1b1656b_m.jpg" width="240" height="125" alt="kGTD - iCal task with Projec and Context" align="right" border="0" hspace="15" vspace="5"></a>And finally, here comes the extra-special sexy. As I laid out in <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">my post about iCal and kGTD</a>, I really like to <em>plan</em> in kGTD and then <em>do</em> out of iCal since it reduces the amount of fiddling and meta work temptation. That doesn&#8217;t mean, however, that I wouldn&#8217;t benefit from a little extra backward integration. </p>

<p>So imagine my  joy that I can now create a new iCal task called &#8220;<code>Call doctor about my crabs &gt; Health Initiative @ phonecalls</code>&#8221; and, on sync, have it create the twin item <em>in the correct project and context</em> back in kGTD. And after that sync, kGTD has the consideration to tidy the unsightly-looking iCal task down to just &#8220;Call doctor about my crabs&#8221; within my &#8220;phonecalls&#8221; calendar. And once again kGTD has picked up the grunt work of managing my tasks from one smart, central, easily accessible location. Ace.</p>

<h3>Plenty more under the hood</h3>

<p>I really do  encourage you to drop by <a href="http://www.kinkless.com/">Kinkless</a> and catch up on <em>all</em> the many new features (and the shiny new site), because it&#8217;s all pretty great. I know people have been clamoring for a new release, but Ethan has been a champ about making sure everything was working properly in this ground-up rewrite. </p>

<p>This is a terrific, innovative, and geek-centric piece of work, and I&#8217;m truly grateful for the hours he&#8217;s put into it. It&#8217;s my system, I love it, and it really  just  works like a sonofabitch.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p><a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2006/03/28/rails-1-1-rjs-active-record-respond_to-integration-tests-and-500-other-things">Rails 1.1 is alive.</a> It's a huge update, the biggest yet, with more than 500 fixes, tweaks, and features from over 100 contributors. It's also a triumph of extractions. Most of the blockbuster features started life in 37signals applications. A rundown:</p>

<ul><li><b>RJS - JavaScript written in Ruby</b>: We initially extracted the Ajax support in Rails from <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">Backpack</a>. It was the first application that I used the send-HTML-instead-of-data approach to Ajax, which became the foundation for the update mechanism in <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>. But as we increased our appetite for Ajax with Campfire, we needed more. RJS was extracted from the work to make all the JavaScript code in <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com">Campfire</a> beautiful.</li>
<li><b>Polymorphic associations/join models</b>: Sunrise gave birth to both of these features as I needed to implement rich tagging against multiple classes (you can tag people, companies, entries, etc with the same tags). This an example of us sharing new features even before the founding application has launched.</li>
<li><b>Accept-driven responses</b>: The <a href="http://basecamphq.com/api/">new Basecamp API</a> is based upon the work I did when <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000572.html">discovering usefulness of the accept header in HTTP</a> and working with Jamis to built a great way to encapsulate that. Now we can have the same code easily serve Ajax-calls, API-calls, mobile clients, and more.</li>
<li><b>ActiveRecord::Base.to_xml</b>: When creating APIs, you usually have to expose tons of model objects as XML (like give me all the todo items for this list in XML). Marking all this XML up by hand every time is tedious. We needed something better to stay productive for the Basecamp API, so to_xml was born.</li>
<li><b>Integration testing</b>: Testing Campfire properly required more than Rails initially provided. How do you verify that things are working right when two or three people are chatting simultaneously? With integration testing that's easy as you can run concurrent sessions and make assertions about the interactions. Jamis extracted this from Campfire and did a great job writing about <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2006/03/09/integration-testing-in-rails-1-1">how to use it</a>.
<li><b>Enumerable#group_by and Array#in_groups_of</b>: How to easily partition data into chunks for presentation? These two methods were born from Campfire's transcript browser by Marcel and Sam.</li>
<li><b>form_for, form_remote_for, and fields_for</b>: Most of the form helpers in Rails was based around the notion that you would only have 1 form per object type per page. Sunrise quickly brought that to same with many forms for similar object types all over the place. So we extracted a new, cleaner way to specify forms and their relationship to models.</li></li></ul>

<p>Frameworks are extractions. The best ideas arise when you're squeezed between the constraints of time, reality, and a desire to be happy writing beautiful code. There was no way we could have come up with all of these new features by simply contemplating what some people might need some day. </p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> 1.1 has been released with an impressive set of new features for a point release.  For a comprehensive list of new features, check out Scott Raymond's <a href="http://scottraymond.net/articles/2006/02/28/rails-1.1">post</a> or the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2006/03/28/rails-1-1-rjs-active-record-respond_to-integration-tests-and-500-other-things">official annoucement.</a></p>
	<p>The Ajax related features include:</p>
	<ul>
<li>RJS templates - Javascript generation in Ruby for common Ajax updates.  Now in addition to .rhtml and .rxml, you'll have .rjs files with ruby to generate your javascript.  For example, taking from <a href="http://scottraymond.net/articles/2005/12/01/real-world-rails-rjs-templates">Scott's example</a>, the following pre-RJS JavaScript code:

The following create method can handles requests from any browser that needs plain html, from a browser with JavaScript support (returns a RJS template by default), and from a web services call expecting XML (returns a HTTP 201 "created" code and nothing else).<br>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><div><p>In openDemocracy, Ehsan Masood <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization/language_3380.jsp">looks at the spread</a> of English language scientific terms and what it may mean for linguistic and cultural diversity.</p><p><blockquote>The issue of language depletion or (at the extreme) language loss is far from abstract. Unesco's Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger of Disappearing, for example, tells us that half of the world's approximately 7,000 spoken languages are endangered to varying degrees. 5,000 of the total number of languages are spoken by groups comprising fewer than 100,000 people; 1,500 have fewer than 1,000 (mostly elderly) speakers.</blockquote></p><p>Should that be a problem for science? There are, after all, many who argue that science is a universal way of understanding the world &#8211; and that the answers to questions such as "what is a gene?", "why is our climate changing?", and "is the universe expanding?" will not be any different if the person trying to answer the question speaks Swahili rather than English or French as a first language.</p><p>It may be true that the search for answers to asking some of life's big questions can in principle be conducted through the medium of any language. But there are many ways in which the existence of multiple languages (each one intrinsically rich and world-encompassing on its own terms) makes this search &#8211; and an exploration of its practical, social and scientific subsets &#8211; more enlightening.</p> </div></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>
With Ajax still being a relatively new technology (just over a year old - well, the term is anyway), there are will some power struggles among the larger companies to see who will be king of the hill. Two major players, Eclipse and Microsoft, are competing for this leadership, according to <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/software/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=183702803&amp;subSection=Enterprise%20Applications">this InformationWeek article</a>. The two have released their own tools to the community in an effort to one-up the other.
</p>
	<p>In <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/software/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=183702803&amp;subSection=Enterprise%20Applications">the article</a>, they present the cases for either side - Eclipse&#8217;s &#8220;Rich Ajax Platform&#8221; and Microsoft with the much anticipated release of their toolset, Atlas. The Eclipse group, is closer to reaching their solution - Microsoft&#8217;s Atlas won&#8217;t actually be released until the next version of Visual Studio is out for public consumption. The Microsoft camp has the advantage of being able to integrate with all of their multitude of applications, but Eclipse has the donated code from IBM to allow for tighter web server integration, with hopes of ultimately leading to easy to generate, more interactive web applications.</p>
	<p>
Of course, neither is sitting back now that their tools are out. They&#8217;re constantly working, improving, and adding new features that will keep the users happy and on their side. You can find out for yourself all of the details around each project from their homepages:</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p><img alt="stomp.jpg" hspace="5" align="left" style="border:thin black solid" src="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/stomp.jpg"> The Indy Gamer blog has noticed that <a href="http://www.mind-control.com">Mind Control Software</a>, the most interesting developers behind IGF winner Oasis, and a host of weird and wonderful prototypes and alternative projects, has <a href="http://indygamer.blogspot.com/2006/04/stomping-grounds.html">released a demo of its latest PC casual title</a>, called Stomping Grounds.</p>

<p>As the blog explains, <a href="http://www.mind-control.com/stompinggrounds/">Stomping Grounds</a> "plays like a card battle game minus all the complicated rules... Each encounter consists of six rounds in total, and a key is awarded for every round won." There's a fun Lion King-esque graphical theme, too.</p>

<p>So basically, it's "a casual action-strategy game", just as <a href="http://www.oasisgame.com/">Oasis</a> switched up a lot of mechanics from more complex PC RTS and turn-based strategy titles into a cohesive casual whole - and honestly, we hope it gets a whole lot more commercial interest that Oasis, which seemed to get somewhat ignored by the casual gameplaying public - anyone hazard a guess as to why?</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><div><p>Today I would like to explain something scientists know well: how computers work, and then use some of the conceptual insights from that discussion to present an interesting recent model of something relatively unknown: how human brains might work. (This model is due to Jeff Hawkins, the inventor of the Palm Pilot--a type of computer, hence the title of this essay.) This may well be rather too-ambitious a task, but oh, well, let&#39;s see how it goes...</p>

<p><strong>Part I: How Computers Work</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/screenhunter_5_1.jpg"><img title="Screenhunter_5_1" height="181" alt="Screenhunter_5_1" src="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/images/screenhunter_5_1.jpg" width="360" border="0" style="FLOAT:right;MARGIN:0px 0px 5px 5px"></a>Far too few people understand how computers operate. Many professional computer programmers, even, would be hard-pressed to explain the workings of the actual hardware, and may well never have heard of an NPN junction, while the <em>average</em> computer user certainly rarely bothers to wonder what goes on inside the CPU (Central Processing Unit, like Intel&#39;s Pentium chip, for example) of her machine when she highlights a paragraph in MS Word and clicks on the &quot;justify&quot; button on the tool bar, and the right margin of the text is instantly and seemingly magically alligned. This lack of curiosity about an amazing technological achievement is inexplicable to me, and it is a shame because computers are extremely beautiful in their complex multi-layered structure. How is it that a bunch of electrons moving around on a tiny silicon wafer deep inside your machine manages to right-justify your text, calculate your taxes, demonstrate a mathematical proof, model a weather-system, and a million other things?</p>

<p>What&#39;s equally weird to me is that I haven&#39;t ever seen a short, comprehensive, <em>and</em> comprehensible explanation of how computers work, so I&#39;m going to give you one. This isn&#39;t going to be easy for me <em>or</em> for you, because computers are not trivial things, but I am hoping to provide a fairly detailed description, not just a bunch of confusing analogies. In other words, this is going to take some strenuous mental effort, and I encourage you to click on the links that I will try to provide, for further details and discussion of some of the topics I bring up. (The beginning part may be tedious for some of you who already know something about computers, but please bear with me.) Last preliminary comment: I will try to make this as simple as possible, but for those of you who don&#39;t know extremely basic things like what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom">electrons</a> are, I really don&#39;t know what to tell you, except that you should. (The humanities equivalent of this scientific ignorance might be someone who doesn&#39;t know what, say, a sonnet is.) Oh, go ahead, click on &quot;electrons.&quot; I&#39;ll wait.</p>

<p>--------------------</p>

<p>Computers are organized hierarchically with layers of conceptual complexity built one on top of the other. This is similar to how our brains work. What I mean is the following: suppose my wife Margit asks me to go buy some bread. It is a simple enough instruction, and she can be fairly certain that a few minutes later I will return with the bread. Here&#39;s what happens in my brain when I hear her request: I break it down into a series of smaller steps something like</p>

<p>Get bread: START</p>

<ol><li>Get money and apartment keys.</li>

<li>Go to supermarket.</li>

<li>Find bread.</li>

<li>Pay for bread.</li>

<li>Return with bread.</li>

<li>END.</li></ol>

<p>Each of these steps is then broken down into smaller steps. For example, &quot;Go to supermarket&quot; may be broken down as follows:</p>

<p>Go to supermaket: START</p>

<ol><li>Exit apartment.</li>

<li>Walk downstairs.</li>

<li>Turn left outside the building and walk until Broadway is reached.</li>

<li>Make right on Broadway and walk one and a half blocks to supermarket.</li>

<li>Make right into supermarket entrance.</li>

<li>END.</li></ol>

<p>Similarly, &quot;Exit apartment&quot; is broken down into:</p>

<p>Exit apartment: START</p>

<ol><li>Get up off couch.</li>

<li>Walk forward three steps.</li>

<li>Turn right and go down hallway until the front door.</li>

<li>If door chain is on, undo it.</li>

<li>Undo deadbolt lock on door.</li>

<li>Open door.</li>

<li>Step outside.</li>

<li>END.</li></ol>

<p>Well, you get the idea. Of course, &quot;Get up off couch&quot; translates into things like &quot;Bend forward&quot; and &quot;Push down with legs to straighten body,&quot; etc. &quot;Bend forward&quot; itself translates into a whole sequence of coordinated muscular contractions. Each muscle contraction is actually a series of biochemical events that take place in the nerve and muscle fibres, and you can continue breaking each step down in this manner to the molecular or atomic level. Notice that most of the action occurs below the threshhold of consciousness, with only the top couple of levels normally available to our conscious minds. Also, I have simplified the example in significant ways, most importantly by neglecting the role of memory retrieval and storage. (There are many retrievals involved here, such as remembering where the store is, where my apartment door is, and even how to walk!) Each subset of instructions in this example is what has come to be known as a subroutine. The beauty of this scheme is that once you have worked out the sequence of smaller steps needed to accomplish a repetitive task which is one level higher in the hierarchy, you can just store that sequence in memory, and you don&#39;t ever need to work it out again. In other words, you can combine subroutines from a given layer into a subroutine which accomplishes some more general task in a higher layer. For example, one could combine the &quot;Get bread&quot; subroutine with the &quot;Get newspaper&quot; and &quot;Get eggs&quot; and &quot;Get coffee&quot; and &quot;Drop off dry-cleaning&quot; subroutines into a &quot;Sunday morning chores&quot; subroutine, which I might then do with little thought every Sunday morning.</p>

<p>This is how computers are able to do such extraordinary things. But I would like to explain some of the detail to you, and the best way to explain it is, I think, again by example. When a user highlights a paragraph of text and clicks on the justify button, here is some of what happens: a subroutine perhaps called &quot;Justify right-hand margin&quot; kicks in. (What that means is that control of the CPU is turned over to this subroutine.) This is what a primitive form of the subroutine might look like (in actual fact, <em>many</em> other things are taken into account) in what programmers call pseudo-code (an informal preliminary way of writing instructions--or laying out an algorithm--which are later carefully translated by the programmer into a higher-level computer language such as BASIC, FORTRAN, Pascal, or C):</p>

<p>Justify right-hand margin: START</p>

<ol><li>First determine the printed width of the text by subtracting the left margin position from the right.</li>

<li>Build a line of text by getting the input (paragraph) text a word at a time. Test to see that the length of the text is less than the printed width.</li>

<li>Output the first word with no following space.</li>

<li>Determine the length of the remaining text, the available space, and the number of word spaces (the same as the remaining words). Divide to get the target word space. (Be sure to take into account the spaces in the string.)</li>

<li>Output the word space, and the next word.</li>

<li>Return to STEP 4 if there is more to print.</li>

<li>Return to STEP 2 for the next line, until no more lines are left.</li>

<li>END.</li></ol>

<p>Of course, FORTRAN or Pascal, or C programmers don&#39;t spend a lot of time actually writing the code (the actual &quot;text&quot; of higher level computer languages is called &quot;code&quot; and the part of programming which takes an algorithm such as the one given above and translates it into the particular syntax of a given language such as C, is called &quot;coding&quot;) for such things, because once they have been written by someone (anyone), they are put into libraries of subroutines and can subsequently be used by anyone needing to (in this case) justify text. Such libraries of useful subroutines are widely available to programmers.</p>

<p>Suppose this subroutine above were written in C. Now what happens to the C code? Who reads that? Well, the way it works is this: there is a program called a compiler, which takes the C code and each of it&#39;s instructions, and breaks them down into a simpler language called assembly language. Assembly language is a limited set of instructions which can be understood by the hardware (the CPU) itself. It consists of instructions like ADD (a, b, c) which, on a given CPU might mean, &quot;add the content of the memory location a to the content of memory location b and store the result in memory location c&quot;. Different CPUs have different instruction sets (and therefore different assembly languages) but the same higher level language can be used on all of them. This is because a compiler for that type of CPU will translate the higher level language into the appropriate assembly language for that CPU. In this way, a program I have written in C to justify text can easily be ported over to a different computer (from a PC to a Mac, say) in the higher level language, without having to worry about how the lower levels accomplish their task. Are you with me? Reread this paragraph if you need to.</p>

<p>Actually, assembly language is itself translated by a program called an assembler into what is called machine language, which is simply a series of zeroes and ones that the hardware can &quot;understand&quot; and operate on. Now we get to the hardware itself. How does the hardware actually perform the instructions given to it? This time, let us start at the bottom of the hierarchy, the silicon itself, and build up from there. Stay with me now!</p>

<p>--------------------</p>

<p><u>P-N Junctions</u></p>

<p>If certain types of impurities (boron, aluminum or gallium, for example) are added (called doping) to the semiconductor material, in this case silicon, it turns into what is known as P-type silicon. This type of silicon has deficiencies of <a href="http://dl.clackamas.cc.or.us/ch104-06/valence_electrons.htm">valence electrons</a> called &quot;holes.&quot; Another type of silicon which can be produced by doping it with different impurities (antimony, arsenic or phosphorous, for example) is known as N-type silicon, a<a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/screenhunter_10.jpg"><img title="Screenhunter_10" height="96" alt="Screenhunter_10" src="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/images/screenhunter_10.jpg" width="185" border="0" style="FLOAT:right;MARGIN:0px 0px 5px 5px"></a>nd this has an <em>excess</em> of free electrons, greatly increasing the intrinsic conductivity of the semiconductor material. The interesting thing about this is that one can place these two materials in contact with one another, and this &quot;junction&quot; behaves differently than either of the two types of silicon by itself. A P-N junction allows an electric current to flow in one direction, but not in the other. This device is known as a diode.</p>

<p><u>Transistors</u></p>

<p><a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/screenhunter_4_2.jpg"></a>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor">transistor</a> is a device with three terminals (a triode--like the glass vacuum tubes of old): the base, the collector, and the emitter. In this device, the current flowing at the collector is controlled by the current between the base and the emitter. <a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/screenhunter_4_3.jpg"><img title="Screenhunter_4_3" height="206" alt="Screenhunter_4_3" src="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/images/screenhunter_4_3.jpg" width="300" border="0" style="FLOAT:right;MARGIN:0px 0px 5px 5px"></a>Transistors can be used as amplifiers, but more importantly in the case of computers, as switches. If you take two P-N junctions and combine them, creating a kind of sandwich, you get either an NPN junction or a PNP junction. These both then function as types of transistors, specifically bipolar junction transistors (BJT). In the case of the NPN junction type transistor, the N on one side acts as the emitter, the P is the base, and the other N is the collector. Refer to the diagram above and click <a href="http://www.mtmi.vu.lt/pfk/funkc_dariniai/transistor/bipolar_transistor.htm">here</a> for more info about how exactly these work in terms of the underlying electronics.</p>

<p><u>Digital Logic Gates</u></p>

<p>Once we have transistors, we can do something very neat with them: we can combine them into what are known as <a href="http://www.williamson-labs.com/480_logic.htm">logic gates</a>. These are best explained by example. Imagine a device with two inputs and one output which behaves in the following way: if a voltage is applied to <em>both</em> inputs, the voltage is also present at the output, otherwise, the output remains at zero. (So if neither or only one of the inputs has a voltage present, the output is zero.) This is known as an AND gate, because its output is positive if and only if the first input AND the second input are &quot;on.&quot; (This &quot;on&quot; state of high voltage usually is used to represent the number 1, while no vo<a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/screenhunter_8.jpg"><img title="Screenhunter_8" height="116" alt="Screenhunter_8" src="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/images/screenhunter_8.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="FLOAT:right;MARGIN:0px 0px 5px 5px"></a>ltage, or low voltage is used to represent the number 0.) Similarly, the output of an OR gate is &quot;1&quot; if either the first input OR the second input OR both of the inputs are &quot;1&quot;. (Still with me? Good. All kinds of exciting stuff is coming up.) A NOT gate simply reverses a 1 to a 0 and vice versa. There are other logic gates, but we won&#39;t bother with them because they can all be simulated by combinations of something called a NAND gate. This is just an AND gate followed by a NOT gate. In other words its output is 0 only if both inputs are 1, otherwise its output is always 1. (See the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table">truth table</a>&quot; at the right. A and B are the inputs and X is the output.)</p>

<p><a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/screenhunter_9.jpg"><img title="Screenhunter_9" height="250" alt="Screenhunter_9" src="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/images/screenhunter_9.jpg" width="150" border="0" style="FLOAT:right;MARGIN:0px 0px 5px 5px"></a>The really cool thing here is that one can combine two of the transistors discussed in the previous section to form a NAND gate. (See the diagram at right to see how they are connected together.) And as I mentioned before, NAND gates can then be connected together in ways that can simulate any kind of logic gate.</p>

<p>Not only that, there are ways of connecting NAND gates together to implement <em>any</em> binary digital function for which we can supply a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table">truth table</a>, with as many inputs and outputs as needed. This is known as digital logic and we can use it to, for example, add two binary numbers, each consisting of some fixed number of zeroes and ones. As I am sure you know, we can represent numbers in any base (including our usual decimal numbers) as binary numbers, so this is a very powerful way of manipulating numbers. In fact we can do many amazing things with these types of gates, including evaluating any statements of propositional logic. This is really the conceptual heart of computing.</p>

<p><a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/screenhunter_11_1.jpg"><img title="Screenhunter_11_1" height="41" alt="Screenhunter_11_1" src="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/images/screenhunter_11_1.jpg" width="67" border="0" style="FLOAT:right;MARGIN:0px 0px 5px 5px"></a>By the way, the standard digital logic symbol of a NAND gate is shown here on the right. (The two inputs are on the left, the output is on the right.)</p>

<p>Now, you should have at least a rough idea of how we can use bits of silicon to do things like add and subtract binary numbers by using voltages to represent zeroes and ones. But what do we do with the result? In other words, where do we store things? This brings us to the other major component of computing: memory.</p>

<p><u>Flip-Flops</u></p>

<p>A flip-flop is a device which can be used to store one bit (a zero or a one) of information. Can you guess how flip-flops are made? Yep, you got it: following our procedure here of building things from stuff we discussed in the previous section, of course, this time we combine NAND gates in ingenious ways to construct them.</p>

<p>There are various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)">types of flip-flops</a>. A flip-flop usually has one or two inputs, an output, and an input from a clock signal (this is why computers must have clocks--and it is the speed of these clocks which is measured when you are told that your laptop runs at, say, 1.9 GigaHertz, which means in this case that the clock signal flips and flops between 0 and 1, back and forth, 1.9 billion times per second). I will here describe a simple type of flip-flop called an SR (or Set/Reset) flip-flop. This is how wikipedia describes it:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT:0px"><p><a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/screenhunter_12.jpg"><img title="Screenhunter_12" height="199" alt="Screenhunter_12" src="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/images/screenhunter_12.jpg" width="140" border="0" style="FLOAT:right;MARGIN:0px 0px 5px 5px"></a>The &quot;set/reset&quot; flip-flop <em>sets</em> (i.e., changes its output to logic 1, or retains it if it&#39;s already 1) if both the S (&quot;set&quot;) input is 1 and the R (&quot;reset&quot;) input is 0 when the clock is strobed. The flip-flop <em>resets</em> (i.e., changes its output to logic 0, or retains it if it&#39;s already 0) if both the R (&quot;clear&quot;) input is 1 and the S (&quot;set&quot;) input is 0 when the clock is strobed. If both S and R are 0 when the clock is strobed, the output does not change. If, however, both S and R are 1 when the clock is strobed, no particular behavior is guaranteed. This is often written in the form of a truth table. [See the table at right.]</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">So, for example, if I want to store a 1 as the output of the flip-flop, I would put 1 on the S input and 0 on the R input. When the clock strobes (flips up to 1) the flip-flop will set to the 1 state as the output. I know this sounds confusing, but just reread it until you are convinced it works. Similarly I can reset it to the zero state by putting 1 on the S input and 0 on the R input. So how are these things constructed out of NAND gates?</p>

<p dir="ltr">I hereby present to you, the SR flip-flop in all its immense digital logic beauty:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/screenhunter_13.jpg"></a><a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/screenhunter_13_1.jpg"><img title="Screenhunter_13_1" height="205" alt="Screenhunter_13_1" src="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/images/screenhunter_13_1.jpg" width="500" border="0"></a> </p>

<p dir="ltr">If you bought a computer recently it may well have come with one billion bytes of internal RAM memory. It takes eight flip-flops to hold one byte of information, and as you can see, it takes eight NAND gates to make this one basic flip-flop which will hold one bit in memory. That&#39;s 128 transistors for a byte of data! Now you know why the original ENIAC computer, which functioned using vacuum tubes instead of transistors, filled a large hall. These days, we can put billions of transistors on a single small silicon chip. (There are ways to make this more efficient, my example is only for rough illustrative purposes.)</p>

<p dir="ltr">There are other flip flops (such as the JK flip-flop) which eliminate the uncertain state of the SR flip-flop when both inputs are 1. There are other improvements and efficiencies which I won&#39;t get into here. (That would be like getting into the choice of materials for head-gaskets while trying to explain how an internal combustion engine works.)</p>

<p dir="ltr">--------------------</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/screenhunter_14.jpg"><img title="Screenhunter_14" height="183" alt="Screenhunter_14" src="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/images/screenhunter_14.jpg" width="360" border="0" style="FLOAT:right;MARGIN:0px 0px 5px 5px"></a>So, starting with just simple bits of silicon, we have seen how we build layer upon conceptual layer (there are armies of engineers and scientists who specialize in each) until we have a processor which can perform arithmetic and logical functions, as well as a memory which can hold the results (or anything else). This is pretty much it! These are the elements which are used to design a machine language for a particular CPU (like the Pentium 5, say). And I have already described the software layers which sit on top of the hardware. I am sure it is obvious that there is much more (libraries-full) to every part of this (for example, I have said nothing about what an operating system does as part of the software layers), but broadly conceptually speaking, this is about it. If you have followed what I have laid out, you now know how electrons zipping about on little pieces of silicon right-justify your text, calculate your taxes, demonstrate a mathematical proof, model a weather-system, and the million other things computers can do.</p>
