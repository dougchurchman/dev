<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>Due to a lack of time and a lack of inspiration, I asked my Berg colleagues to help write my blog entry this week. Inspired by a recent <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/04/19/135235284/pop-culture-happy-hour-comfort-food-for-your-weary-soul">NPR Pop Culture Happy Hour podcast</a>, I asked them what they would consider their pop culture &#8220;comfort foods&#8221;: music, movies, books, TV shows, games, etc that they return to time and again because they are comfortable and familiar, bring you back to a happy place, create a certain feeling in you, etc. NPR&#8217;s Linda Holmes described it as things that &#8220;we turn to when we get into a cultural rut and want to reawaken our love of the things we love, as it were.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can think of so many things that fit in this category for me. Here&#8217;s a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sound of Music (both the film and the soundtrack)</li>
<li>Pride and Prejudice &#8211; both the book and the films (both the Colin Firth &amp; Jennifer Ehle version and the Keira Knightley &amp; Matthew Mcfadyen version)</li>
<li>The West Wing</li>
<li>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</li>
<li>U2 &#8211; Achtung Baby (brings me right back to my first year at university)</li>
<li>Hem &#8211; Eveningland</li>
<li><em>A House Like a Lotus</em> and <em>A Ring of Endless Light</em> by Madeleine L&#8217;Engle</li>

<p>I&#8217;m happy to say that everyone in the studio humoured my request. Here&#8217;s what they had to say:</p>
<p><strong>Jack Schulze</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Point Break</li>
<li>Winnie the Pooh</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timo Arnall</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<li>Also Rhubarb and Custard (As a kid I slept under the animation table at Bob Godfrey Studios on Neal St, still remember Bob doing the voices).</li>
<li>I still return to many of Kieslowski&#8217;s films, they were formative in my understanding of film.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Matt Jones</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade</li>
<li>The Invisibles</li>
<li>&#8220;Can&#8217;t buy a thrill&#8221; by Steely Dan</li>
</ul>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><div><p>A lot of my time as a design executive is spent defending the value of the unquantifiable. Business pressures argue for design compromises with some quantifiable and significant ROI (Return on Investment). But as Adaptive Path put it in their report on <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/ideas/reports/businessvalue">Leveraging Business Value: How ROI Changes User Experience</a>, &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to measure ROI for user experience with a simple equation that can be applied across a wide swath of companies and projects.&#8221; And, in my experience, perhaps the hardest thing to quantify is the value of negative space: the space <em>between</em> your user interface elements.</p>
<p>Typically brand new apps have lots of space, because UI elements represent features, which require code, which requires time and money. With time and money, however, the app evolves, and the empty space is quickly filled in with new features. The availability of room, in fact, can contribute greatly to the decision to place a button in what was previously empty space. &#8220;Users are asking for this feature, and it looks like there&#8217;s room for us to squeeze in another button on the toolbar, so let&#8217;s do the feature and make it a toolbar button.&#8221;</p>
<p>I rarely hear discussion about setting aside room in a user interface for the <em>absence</em> of user interface elements. Speaking both aesthetically and from a usability perspective, negative space can be highly valuable in an interface. Used effectively, it can create a sense of calm, balance, manageability, and competence. It can help guide the user&#8217;s eyes across the page towards what&#8217;s important. The presence of space can separate things that are different; the absence of space can join things that are similar.</p>
<p>Cozi&#8217;s current web page template leaves some significant negative space in the lower left (above the clock), as well as a bit in the upper right. Both those spaces vary in size depending on the window dimensions. (The calendar view itself also has considerable space, but that&#8217;s highly dependent on which view is selected and how much data is on the calendar.)</p>
<p><a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451fb6769e20154326e3f8a970c-pi"><img alt="2010.09.17" border="0" height="480" src="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451fb6769e2014e888ee2ff970d-pi" style="background-image:none;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;display:inline;padding-top:0px;border:0px" title="2010.09.17" width="640"></a></p>
<p>The challenge is that negative space doesn&#8217;t <em>look</em> like it&#8217;s doing anything. It can appear inefficient&#8212;like a lost opportunity. In a business driven by display advertising, there is pressure to make pixels generate revenue. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to count the value that effective negative space contributes to a user experience, but it&#8217;s very easy to estimate the rent those same pixels might generate if they were converted to display advertising inventory. The thing is, those empty pixels <em>are</em> doing something. The user experience would be different&#8212;worse&#8212;if the space were filled.</p>
<p>(The Leaderboard ad in the image above is actually a different problem. That ad isn&#8217;t filling space that was previously empty; it&#8217;s consuming space that would otherwise be used to show user data. See my earlier post on why <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2010/08/its-easier-to-imagine-hiding-an-ad-than-completely-redesigning-a-ui.html">it&#8217;s easier for users to image hiding an ad than completely redesigning a UI</a>.)</p>
<p>Negative space is hard concept to love, but it turns out that most people demonstrate an intuitive grasp of negative space in the context of their own homes. In home after home, you can observe that the occupants have very carefully hung pictures or paintings on the wall so as to give each piece space to breathe. You will rarely see a bunch of paintings crammed together on a wall. Most people effectively use negative space with no training beyond the casual observations of positive examples in other homes, museums, offices, or anywhere art is displayed. At some subconscious level, people must be so sensitive to the value of negative space that they are willing to do work to preserve negative space in their own surroundings.</p>
<p>The defense of the negative space in a user experience, however, is a never-ending battle. New proposals to &#8220;fill that space in&#8221; with a new feature, ad, or other element arise on a monthly, sometimes weekly, basis. Defense of the open space is wearisome but necessary. Once that&#8217;s space is gone, it&#8217;s usually gone forever.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/flowstate/~4/sDYdnr-Q1GE" height="1" width="1"></div></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p><a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/8/2011/05/104884-wall_e.jpg"><img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/8/2011/05/500x_104884-wall_e.jpg" width="500" alt="The hidden posthuman messages in Pixar movies" title="The hidden posthuman messages in Pixar movies"></a> Futurist Kyle Munkittrick has an interesting essay about Pixar movies over at Discover's Science Not Fiction blog, where he argues that most of the studio's films are offering a message about how non-human creatures (like robots or rats) are just as sentient as humans are, and deserve to be treated like people. He sees this as a distinctly transhuman or posthuman perspective, a sensibility that everyone might share in a future with intelligent robots and uplifted animals.</p>
<p>It's tempting to say, "well, all animated movies are about talking animals and toys," but the difference is that in Pixar movies this is treated as a significant issue. We're not in a <em>101 Dalmations</em> universe of fantasy, where we just take for granted that dogs talk because the movie is from the dogs' point of view. Instead, we're in a world of humans and non-human sentient creatures, and the non-humans often have to work hard to persuade the humans that they deserve what amount to human rights. Here's what Munkittrick writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In each Pixar film, at least one member of the team is human and at least one member is not human but possesses human levels of intelligence.</p>
<p>You can see where I'm going here. Particularly in <em>WALL&#8226;E, Ratatouille</em> and <em>Up!</em> there is no ambiguity about the reality of intelligence in the non-human characters. Each Pixar film asks us to accept one deviation from our reality. While it seems like the deviation is different in every case (e.g. monsters are real, robots can fall in love, fish have a sense of family, Kevin is a girl, a rat can cook), the simple fact is that</p>
<p>Pixar only asks us to accept one idea over and over and over again: <strong>Non-humans are sentient beings. That is the central difference between Pixar's universe and our current reality</strong> . . .</p>
<p>Taken together as a whole narrative, the Pixar canon diagrams what will likely this century's main rights battle &#8211; the rights of personhood &#8211; in three stages.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong> are the Humans as Villain stories, in which the non-humans discover and develop personhood. I mean, Buzz Lightyear's character arc is about his becoming self-aware as a toy. These films represent nascent personhood among non-human entities. For the viewer, we begin to see how some animals and items we see as mindless may have inner lives of which we are unaware.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong> are the Humans as Partners stories, in which exceptional non-humans and exceptional humans share a moment of mutual recognition of personhood. The moment when Linguini realizes Remy is answering him is second only to the moment when Remy shows Ego around the kitchen &#8211; such beautiful transformations of the Other into the self. These films represent the first forays of non-human persons into seeking parity with human beings.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, and finally, there is The Incredibles, which turns the personhood equation on its head. Instead of portraying the struggle for non-humans to be accepted as human, The Incredibles shows how human enhancement, going beyond the human norm, will trigger equally strong reactions of revulsion and otherization. The message, however, is that the human traits we value have nothing to do with our physical powers but are instead based in our moral and emotional bonds. Beneficence and courage require far more humanity than raw might. The Incredibles teaches a striking lesson: human enhancement does not make you inhuman &#8211; the choices you make and the way you treat others determines how human you really are.</p>
<p>Pixar has given those who would fight for personhood the narratives necessary to convince the world that non-humans that display characteristics of a person deserve the rights of a person. For every category there is a character: uplifted animals (Dug), naturally intelligent species (Remy and Kevin), A.I robots (WALL-E, EVE), and alien/monsters (Sully &amp; Mike). Then there is the Incredible family, transhumans with superpowers. Through the films, these otherwise strange entities become unmistakably familiar, so clearly akin to us.</p>
<p><strong>The message hidden inside Pixar's magnificent films is this: humanity does not have a monopoly on personhood. In whatever form non- or super-human intelligence takes, it will need brave souls on both sides to defend what is right. If we can live up to this burden, humanity and the world we live in will be better for it.</strong></p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/movies/paddy-chayefskys-notes-for-network-film.html?_r=1&amp;hpw=&amp;pagewanted=all">New York Times piece on Paddy Chayevsky&#8217;s archive</a> is amazing. The NYT seems really way out ahead of the field in terms of presenting primary sources online; I mean, just <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/05/22/movies/chayefsky-archives.html#document">look at this document viewer</a>. It&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a highlight: Chayevsky created <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/05/22/movies/chayefsky-archives.html#document/p3/a21521">an entire programming grid</a> for UBS&#8212;the network in &#8220;Network&#8221;&#8212;with shows like &#8220;Lady Cop,&#8221; &#8220;Death Squad,&#8221; and the one-two punch of &#8220;Celebrity Canasta&#8221; and &#8220;Celebrity Mahjong.&#8221;</p>
<p>I so dearly wish this pilot existed:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1968, he started writing a pilot script for a comedic series he called &#8220;The Imposters&#8221; or &#8220;There&#8217;s No Business,&#8221; about subversives who infiltrate a television network and undermine it from within.</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, you can count on Aaron Sorkin for the kicker:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sorkin, however, spoke for &#8220;Network&#8221; fans who respond to it as a devastating media-industry critique&#8212;one whose author never saw television devolve into a vast wasteland of reality programming and political partisanship, but who after 35 years is still shouting just as loudly about the dangers of crass, pandering content.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you put it in your DVD player today you&#8217;ll feel like it was written last week,&#8221; Mr. Sorkin said. &#8220;The commoditization of the news and the devaluing of truth are just a part of our way of life now. You wish Chayefsky could come back to life long enough to write &#8216;The Internet.&#8217; &#8221;</p></blockquote>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>While at Maker Faire this last weekend, I got into a conversation with a couple of other geek dads who tracked me down to talk about LEGO robotics. As we stood in a food line, we discussed our hobbies, our kids (all three of us were sans children at the event), and growing up geek. The talk ended with us discussing our various gaming backgrounds as kids, specifically early video games and computer games. I wrote last week about my <a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/05/returning-to-my-gaming-roots-by-revisiting-infocom-text-adventures/">renewed interest in the Infocom games</a> and we all enjoyed sharing our favorite moments from some of those great text-adventure games. (Apologies to Tyler for spoiling the ending of <em>Infidel</em>&#8230; I can&#8217;t believe I griped about it without checking to make certain they&#8217;d played it.)</p>
<p>After we all had written down some games we&#8217;d missed and would be checking out, Sam mentioned X-Com. All three of us yelled so loudly that we got funny looks from the other families enjoying their lunch around us. Who knew a 20+ year old game would still have such an effect on three grown men?</p>
<div style="width:210px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-69039" href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/05/geekdad-retro-gaming-x-com-ufo-defense/xcom1/"><img title="XCOM1" src="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/XCOM1-200x124.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="124"></a><p>Real Satellite View - Honest</p></div>
<p>If you&#8217;ve played <em>X-Com</em>, then you likely know the draw to it and can understand. If you&#8217;ve heard of <em>X-Com</em> but never played it, you&#8217;ve likely heard a dozen or more arguments why you should go hunt it down and play. And if you&#8217;ve never heard of <em>X-Com</em>, I wish I could trade places with you and enjoy the game again as a completely new and unaware player.</p>
<p><em>X-Com</em> doesn&#8217;t have the modern day graphics as you can see from the included screenshots. It&#8217;s turn-based, too &#8212; meaning that in combat game mode you specify the actions you wish to take (or more accurately, that you wish for your soldiers to take) and then after the characters have moved, fired their weapons, ducked behind cover, or lost their minds&#8230; well, then it&#8217;s the aliens&#8217; turn.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<div style="width:210px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-69040" href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/05/geekdad-retro-gaming-x-com-ufo-defense/xcom2/"><img title="XCOM2" src="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/XCOM2-200x122.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="122"></a><p>Run away!</p></div>
<p>The game is about alien invasion and Earth&#8217;s attempt to fight back. But the game isn&#8217;t all about fighting the aliens. This game has so much more: base building, tech researching, manufacturing, dogfights between UFOs and fighter jets, and even money management practice! The game simply doesn&#8217;t let up while you&#8217;re playing. Once you build that first base, you&#8217;ve got to buy ammo and missiles for your jets, build new facilities (tip: get an alien containment facility up fast for captured alien prisoners), select the best alien technology to research, assign engineers to duplicate alien tech, load up your transport, and, oh yeah&#8230; intercept and shoot down marauding UFOs and then send the soldiers in to mop up, collect any prisoners and weapons, and head home to rest for the next battle.</p>
<div style="width:210px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-69041" href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/05/geekdad-retro-gaming-x-com-ufo-defense/xcom3/"><img title="XCOM3" src="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/XCOM3-200x124.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="124"></a><p>All Your Base Are Belong to Us</p></div>
<p>Once a month, however, you&#8217;ll find the aliens mounting a more aggressive Terror Attack. You&#8217;ve got to send in your best soldiers, arm them to the teeth, and hope they can exit the transport and get to cover before being ambushed by the surprisingly good and sneaky computer-controlled aliens. (I&#8217;ve renamed my soldiers after GeekDad contributors &#8212; sorry, Ken, but you were quickly taken over by alien mind control and started shooting at your buddies. You had to be put down.)</p>
<p>As the game progresses, the aliens get more powerful and the governments of the world raise their expectations and reward successful missions (and sometimes ally with the aliens if results start to slide). You&#8217;ve got to keep researching, keep manufacturing, and keep building new bases. I&#8217;ve just started a new game, but one old game that sticks out in my mind had a final count of 10 bases spread over the globe &#8212; the most fun attacks are the base attacks where you&#8217;ve got to defend your base from the aliens.&#160; Failure is not an option, so SAVE frequently!</p>
<div style="width:210px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-69042" href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/05/geekdad-retro-gaming-x-com-ufo-defense/xcom4/"><img title="XCOM4" src="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/XCOM4-200x125.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="125"></a><p>Seriously?! I just deplaned!</p></div>
<p>Over time you&#8217;ll discover a large assortment of aliens with all sorts of surprises, including hints of a bigger conspiracy that will lead to the endgame that is out of this world.</p>
<p><em>X-Com: UFO Defense</em> is, and always will be, one of my all-time favorite games. It just doesn&#8217;t get old. You can play a bit, save your progress, and come back later to pick up where you left off &#8212; no checkpoints, no multiplayer, and no in-game purchases required. It&#8217;s old school fun.</p>
<p>If you like the game and haven&#8217;t played the sequel, <em>X-Com: Terror from the Deep</em>, it&#8217;s just as good (some argue that it&#8217;s even better). I can remember spending hours sending my soldiers to the various nooks and crannies of a cruise ship that was the site of a Terror Landing &#8212; those aliens were devious and always hiding in the smallest rooms or circling around to surprise you from behind. (There are even more sequels but I haven&#8217;t heard much good about anything beyond <em>X-COM: TftD</em> &#8211; any readers want to chime in?)</p>
<div style="width:210px"><a rel="attachment wp-att-69043" href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/05/geekdad-retro-gaming-x-com-ufo-defense/xcom5/"><img title="XCOM5" src="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/XCOM5-200x124.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="124"></a><p>Why is Ken acting funny?</p></div>
<p><em>X-Com: UFO Defense</em> can be purchased from Steam (<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/">steampowered.com</a>) for $4.99, an unbelievable price for a game that will give you hours of enjoyment.</p>
<p>And for those of you who have finished <em>X-Com: UFO Defense</em> and are looking for more, I&#8217;ve got great news for you &#8212; an homage to <em>X-Com</em> called <a href="http://xenonauts.com/">Xenonauts </a>is close to completion. I&#8217;ll be putting up a detailed review in the weeks to come, and I&#8217;m going to have to try really hard to remain impartial. It&#8217;ll be a tough assignment, but I&#8217;ll push through and try to keep a smile off my face as I play.</p>
<p>Sharing time &#8212; geek dads, any great experiences to share about <em>X-Com</em> games? Please remember to label spoilers or just avoid them altogether if possible. (Sorry again, Tyler, about <em>Infidel</em>.)</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p><strong>The food truck scene in Louisville has exploded recently.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we&#8217;re a bit behind bigger cities like LA and New York, but better late than never, amirite?</p>
<p>These food trucks seem to understand what it takes to really promote a mobile food movement in the city. The businesses maintain active social networking pages to keep customers informed of their whereabouts, and all welcome inquiries regarding catering for events.</p>
<p>The trucks also work together. I just saw on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Morelsfoodtruck">Facebook</a> that there will be a &#8220;Food Truckus Ruckus&#8221; on June 18 at Fresh Start Growers Supply at Baxter and Jefferson streets.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of some Louisville food trucks and their websites. Bookmark these links to better follow each food truck&#8217;s location around the greater Louisville area. Know of one missing from the list? As usual, take it to the comments.</p>

<div class='item alternatelook'><span class='itemorigin clearfix span8' id = 'item113'><a href='http://blog.frankchimero.com/'>via Frank</a> <br></br> 06/27/2011 04:18 PM</span><span class='itemtitle em'><a href = 'http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/6984494439'>Sorting a Mass</a></span>
<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>To prepare for an upcoming <a href="http://2011.dconstruct.org/conference/frank-chimero">lecture</a>, I&#8217;ve been thinking about the relationship between collecting and curating. This morning, I tweeted:</p>

<blockquote>Thinking about collecting vs. curating, and how the internet is muddying the line between the two.</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#8217;t realize it at the time, but it seems I hit something unexpected with that tweet. I received many responses from folks telling me what they thought the line between the two were. The gist for most is:</p>

<blockquote>Collection is additive. Curation is subtractive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Collecting is for yourself, curating is for others.</blockquote>

<p>The size of the group of things and the presence of an audience are the two characteristics that are used as touchstones. Those seem to be the right things to discuss, but the internet makes them trickier to pin down.</p>

<p>For instance, I would consider my Pinboard account a collection of links, but it has an audience because it is public. Is it still a collection?</p>

<p>Or, many of the blogs that people say are curated are usually a group of beautiful images rolling down a webpage. What distinguishes that from my Pinboard page of links?</p>

<p>See? Messy!</p>

<p>I think the thing that separates the two is intent, not in the size of the pool of stuff or in the presence of an audience, but rather in the implied purpose of the gathering of content. To me, collecting is usually about propagation&#8212;the collection grows in quantity and diversity. Curating seems to be about illumination, and having that set of selected items, no matter the size, come to a point.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve recently launched another blog called <a href="http://www.themavenist.org">The Mavenist</a>, which could be considered a collection, but it feels to be squarely in the realm of curation. What is the difference? It is in the arrangement. Collecting is having all the pearls lose on the table, curating is stringing them together into a necklace. (Of course, there is no better or worse between those two situations. One just has an extra pass of arrangement.) This is why <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/frank-sparrow/favorites/">my Flickr favorites</a> feels like a collection, while a <a href="http://www.pictorymag.com/showcases/danger/">feature on Pictory</a> is definitely a curatorial endeavor.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d say that the web seems to be mostly comprised of collections, because we don&#8217;t frequently arrange the things that we have found. Curation is marked by a larger structure, a gestalt made by the arrangement of individual items, sort of like a constellation of stars. The first step of curation, much like collecting, is selecting (and there is an art to that). The second is arranging and sorting those things in a purposeful way. We choose the stars in a constellation, but they become Orion&#8217;s Belt because of their position, arrangement, and the prescribed meaning we put on that particular arrangement.</p>

<p>This means that it&#8217;s worth considering how we sort things on the web. Information architecture luminary <a href="http://www.wurman.com/rsw/">Richard Saul Wurman</a> said that all information can be arranged in a few different ways. He called it LATCH:</p>
<ul><li>Location</li><li>Alphabet</li><li>Time</li><li>Category</li><li>Hierarchy</li></ul><p>Right now, chronological ordering is the default way to arrange content online, and I wonder how that blanket presumption affects curation on the web. Does it make sense, because people check in frequently, or is it odd, like sorting a stack of photographs alphabetically by who is in them? There are indeed instances where sorting by time is the correct path, but it will be exciting over the next few months and years to see what happens to the web as we recognize the instances where the newest thing is not necessarily the most important thing. (And, as always, the additional problem on top of this: can this sorting process be automated?)</p>

<p>But can you curate on the web? Most curation comes to a point through narrative, and is narrative possible on the web? Stories require a certain amount of linearity, and we all know how the web disrupts that. Maybe it is the same problem that video games have, where <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6625747/la-noire">interactivity subverts storytelling.</a> In my own attempts, I&#8217;ve tried to create narrative by using the one linear experience I could find: <a href="http://www.lostworldsfairs.com/atlantis/">scrolling.</a> I&#8217;m still not sure on this one, because scrolling to tell a story, while fun, doesn&#8217;t really scale across the web.</p>

<p>But is scrolling through a collection the same? I think it&#8217;s important to note that while we may collect for ourselves, those collections are being published, creating incidental audiences. I collect my Flickr favorites for me, but they are accessible to you, so what obligations do I have to you when I consider to favorite something? What happens when sharing is the default rather than purposeful? It blurs the line between curation and collecting into something more of a gradient than a binary this-or-that. And that&#8217;s why those neat definitions in the tweets seem slightly off. The situation isn&#8217;t as tidy as it used to be. The line between curating and collecting has turned into a situation similar to when you ask someone to describe what makes something vulgar. The answer for both is the same: &#8220;I&#8217;ll know it when I see it.&#8221;</p></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><div><p>I can't help but notice over the last few days how great Google's suite of apps is looking these days. Though the top black bar threw me for a loop at first, I got used to it after a day and now that I've tried <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/preview-of-gmails-new-look.html">the new Gmail theme designs</a>, as well as the new Google Plus, I'm kind of amazed at how well everything looks, works, and feels. It's kind of like that euphoric feeling the week after a new major OS update comes out for your favorite computer and everything just works better.</p>
<p>People thought it was Google hiring original Macintosh designer Andy Hertzfeld, but <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117840649766034848455/posts/FddaP6jeCqp">he set the record straight</a> that his role was small and it was a whole team of great designers.</p>
<p>Here's my pet hypothesis: A bunch of designers at Google figured out a way to make their user testing reveal the benefits of better looking apps, sites, and pages. I don't know how they did it, either by honestly sharing better looking apps or subterfuge, either way I don't care because I love the end result and it's something I never thought in a million years would happen, but Google products suddenly look <em>well-designed</em>.</p></div><div>

<p style="text-align:center">&#8220;&#8217;Cause I don&#8217;t care too&#8230; much for money, money can&#8217;t buy me love&#8220; &#8211; The Beatles</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;ve decided to take on the challenge of <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2008/01/16/stop-hanging-out-with-women-and-start-dating-them/">dating women instead of simply hanging out with them</a>, there&#8217;s both good news and bad news.</p>
<p>The bad news is that you&#8217;re going to have to overcome your nervousness and fear of rejection.</p>
<p>But the good news is that taking women out on dates doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive. It simply takes a little more thought.</p>
<p>Too many men make the mistake of believing they can buy their way out of thinking. But creative, cheap dates are often the best kind. They&#8217;re more memorable than the standard dinner and a movie, and when a woman sees that you&#8217;re thoughtful, she won&#8217;t care how much dough you spent on taking her out (if she&#8217;s a keeper, that is).</p>
<p>So here are 10 fiscally responsible options for when you&#8217;re short on cash but still want to impress her with a terrific date&#8230;</p>
<h3><strong>1. Wine Tasting</strong></h3>
<p><img title="wine" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/07/wine.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="250"></p>
<p>Wineries are sprouting up everywhere this side of Antarctica. Most of these upstarts allow wine tasting for free or for a very small price (and often times, those that charge let you keep the glass.) Go and learn about the different wines, what they pair well with, and keep mental notes on which varietals she enjoys the most. Knowing a woman&#8217;s preferred type of wine isn&#8217;t as important as knowing her eye color, but it helps. As counter-intuitive as it may feel for those of us who see wasting alcohol as a mortal sin, make sure you use that spit bucket. You&#8217;re driving, you need to be responsible, and if you swallow every taste you&#8217;re not going to be fit to drive her home. You don&#8217;t have to spit every taste, but showcase some restraint. She&#8217;ll notice and appreciate it.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Hit a Flea Market</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike antique shops, flea markets seem geared for the young and not as affluent. The merchandise is almost always more interesting if not downright weird. Same goes for the people in attendance and those who are selling the goods. You can watch people barter, look over pieces of furniture that are probably haunted, and maybe pick up some small gift for your date if something inexpensive catches her eye. If it&#8217;s jewelery? Who knows. Maybe it won&#8217;t even turn her skin green. (Or it could end up being some awesome treasure). Try and stick to outdoor flea markets that have a good reputation. Not those once in a blue moon indoor sales which charge you an arm and a leg before you even get to lay eyes on what&#8217;s for sale.</p>
<h3><strong>3. The Sunset Hike + Post Pub Visit</strong></h3>
<p><img title="couplehiking_d" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/07/couplehiking_d.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="348"></p>
<p>Going for a meandering walk with no real destination can be fun, but hiking to the top of an easy to get to peak to watch the sun go down gives you purpose. Keep it to under 45 minutes. You don&#8217;t want to go on some epic journey only to end up stumbling through the dark. Reward yourselves with a beer or glass of wine afterwards at a cozy pub. This works terrific in the fall when you can see all the changing leaves around you.</p>
<h3><strong>4. The Photography-Filled Afternoon</strong></h3>
<p>File this one under the category of two-birds/one stone. Most of us have relatives in other parts of the country (or world) and you never know what to get them for their birthday or the holidays. Go on a photo hunting expedition in your hometown for the places and scenes that best represent where you live. When you&#8217;re all done, pick 12 of the best and hit one of the many websites that allow you to upload photos and create wall calendars. There&#8217;s your gift for Grandma and Grandpa who live a few time zones away and would love a reminder of what it looks like where you live.</p>
<h3><strong>5. The Bicycle Picnic</strong></h3>
<p><img title="bike" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/07/bike.jpg" alt="" width="372" height="429"></p>
<p>Picnics are always at the top of everyone&#8217;s list for cheap and romantic dates. But mixing in a leisurely long bike ride can make a nice difference. It&#8217;s relaxing, you get to enjoy some scenery on the way, and it&#8217;s far more romantic and engaging when compared to fighting through traffic and finding a place to park. Keep the menu simple, know any open container laws that might apply to your eventual picnic destination, and make sure you&#8217;ve got a backpack and bike gear rack that can handle your load. Take a bike lock with you. You might end up taking a detour on the way home for ice cream.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Take a Historical Walking Tour of Your Town</strong></h3>
<p>Almost always free, historical walking tours actually make you stop and appreciate the history that most of us drive by every single day. We&#8217;ve got our own point As and point Bs, and most of us rarely spend time focusing on the places in-between. Usually these tours are led by volunteers who can be real characters, and the buildings and their stories are never boring. Both (the guides and history) will provide for plenty of conversation at the cafe or bar afterward. Nostalgia, history, architecture, an appreciation for the past&#8230; it&#8217;s all wrapped up in one of these on-foot freebies.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Cheering on Your Local Roller Derby Girls</strong></h3>
<p><img title="roller" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/07/roller.jpg" alt="" width="417" height="328"></p>
<p>For the cost of one cheap seat at most major league games, you and your date could watch one of the hundreds of local roller derby clubs duke it out with a rival. Usually a ticket will let you see a couple of bouts, and the speed and spills are the real deal. It&#8217;s something different but still sports related, with just enough adrenaline, which doesn&#8217;t involve sweaty guys for once.</p>
<h3><strong>8. The Untraditional Movie Night</strong></h3>
<p>There are two options here. First, if you&#8217;ve just jumped into a relationship, skip the new romantic comedy that just hit the Redbox, and instead go with a classic like <em>Casablanca</em>, <em>To Catch a Thief</em>, or even the goofy-as-all-get-out original <em>Ocean&#8217;s 11</em>. Grab some takeout, make a meal, or <a title="5 Classic Cocktails Every Man Should Know" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/01/5-classic-cocktails-every-man-should-know/">have some cocktails</a> on hand that line up with the plot or location of your chosen old Hollywood story. Set an upscale mood by dressing up a bit. You don&#8217;t want to look like you&#8217;re settling in for a night on the couch because you have the flu. Just because you&#8217;re at home watching a movie, doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t dress up for her.</p>
<p>For those that have been in a relationship for awhile, consider reenacting your first movie date. We all (should) know the first movie we saw with our significant other. Find it for cheap on DVD, grab a wicker type basket from a craft store, dress it up with some tissue paper, and load it up with popcorn, M&amp;Ms, and other movie theater-type snacks. Deliver it to her and ask her over for a movie night. Should cost you less than the arm and a leg you spent on just the popcorn and sodas alone when you two first saw it in the theater.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Farmer&#8217;s Market in the Morning, Making Dinner Together That Evening</strong></h3>
<p>Staying in and <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2011/03/18/the-10-commandments-of-the-at-home-dinner-date/">making dinner together</a> is as romantic as it gets, but use your dinner date as an excuse to hit your local farmer&#8217;s market that morning. Stroll past the different vendors, and eventually you&#8217;ll start assembling a pile of fresh local ingredients that you can use that evening. You don&#8217;t have to get everything at the market. Maybe just the foundational items for each course&#8211;perhaps a couple bunches of kale to saute up with some olive oil and garlic, a couple of local organic chicken breasts that will be plenty easy to stuff, and some berries to pair up with shortcake for dessert. Get creative, then use the middle of the day to find some easy recipes and pick up the rest of the ingredients you&#8217;ll need.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Monopoly. Loser Buys Dinner or Drinks</strong></h3>
<p><img title="cards2" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/07/cards2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="307"></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t scoff at board games (or cards). They can make for a terrific evening in (if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for). Put a friendly couples related wager down on the outcome (dinner, drinks&#8230; I&#8217;m sure your imagination is wandering to other places). It&#8217;ll make the game all the more interesting. Skip Scrabble or Trivial Pursuit. Those can get too mentally competitive. Monopoly has enough chance involved that no one&#8217;s feelings will get hurt (yours included) if someone completely dominates the other. And dominate Monopoly you will if you nab those orange properties (it&#8217;s true, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/294260.stm">they&#8217;ve done studies</a>). Win, and if the prize includes a night out on her dime? Then this cheap date idea just produced another. Well&#8230; for you at least.</p>
