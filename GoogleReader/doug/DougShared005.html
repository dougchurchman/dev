Drumming in <em>Rock Band</em> got you licked? Can't get your feet and hands to
do what you want them to? You're not alone. Even if you're an expert
videogame guitar player, drumming is a whole new can of worms. In fact,
it's practically identical to the actual instrument, which means that
if you want to start from scratch and work your way up to Expert level,
you've got a lot of practice ahead of you.</p>

<p>
But we at Game|Life have brought reinforcements. We've been exchanging
emails with Harmonix designers and expert drummers Rob Kay and Jeff
Allen, who have agreed to share with us -- and you! -- some of their
wisdom.</p>

<p>
You don't actually have to sit down and play the songs over and over if
you want to improve. There are some simple techniques that you can try
that will help you in the game, and you don't even have to turn <em>Rock
Band</em> on to try them. We'll show you tricks that help you develop better
form, and some practice routines that you can try to develop limb
independence.</p><p>Rob and Jeff want to emphasize that in the tips they've provided below, they've covered a lot. Don't try to do all of this at once -- start with the basic tips, practice each one until you see some improvement in your play, and then move on to the next one.</p>

<p><strong>Kick Pedal (Basic)</strong></p>

<p>Above all, keep in mind that the best sitting position will have your leg forming a right angle when you rest your foot on the pedal. You should be using mostly your calf muscles -- your quads shouldn&#8217;t be doing much work at all.</p>

<p>The classic mistake that new players make is to stomp on the pedal from a great height, leaving their foot floating in the air between hits. This is poor pedal technique, and it doesn&#8217;t take long for poor pedal technique to result in leg pain, especially on challenging drum songs. </p>

<p>Good foot pedal technique, on the other hand, isn&#8217;t painful because it&#8217;s all about moving your foot as little as possible. The less energy you use on each hit, the more hits you can perform, and the better a drummer you&#8217;ll be.</p>

<p>The next time you play, make a conscious effort to keep your foot resting on the pedal throughout a song. Drummers call this the "Heel-down" or "Flat-footed" technique. Don&#8217;t let your foot leave the pedal. </p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve got that licked, practice leaving the pedal pressed all the way down between hits. Don&#8217;t let the pedal rise back up until you actually need it to for the next hit. Once you train your leg to play like this, everything becomes way easier. You don&#8217;t even need to let the pedal rise up very far between hits -- about half of its full range is plenty. </p>

<p>Combine these three things successfully -- foot always on the pedal, foot down between hits, only letting the pedal up a little between hits -- and you&#8217;ll soon find yourself destroying songs that previously seemed impossible.</p>

<p><strong>Kick Pedal (Advanced)</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.wired.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/01/10/heels.jpg"><img width="190" height="222" border="0" src="http://blog.wired.com/games/images/2008/01/10/heels.jpg" title="Heels" alt="Heels" style="margin:0px 0px 5px 5px;float:right"></a>
For Easy and Medium, the natural inclination is to use Heel-down, as described above. This gives the player more of a feeling of control. But to get your speed up, you have to practice a lot to maintain that control without tiring, or hurting the muscle next to your shin.</p>

<p>For Hard and Expert, where kick gems begin to come in more rapid succession, we would recommend that the player experiment with the &#8220;Heel-up&#8221; technique, which is more commonly used by rock drummers (see images at right, <a href="http://www.drums-and-drum-sets.com/bass-pedal-technique.php">source</a>). This means that the ball of your foot stays on the pedal, while the heel is raised about an inch. </p>

<p>When a series of kick gems come down the lane, the motion becomes a controlled bouncing. The pedal will hold the weight of your leg while you flick the ball of your foot downward. You can also choose where the ball of your foot lies. If you rest your foot a few inches back on the pedal, you can reduce the travel distance of the pedal, which means you can achieve greater speed. But since the game pedal lacks the mechanics of a real kick pedal, pushing against the spring will be tougher.</p>

<p><strong>Hands</strong></p>

<p>The most immediate obstacle that one will face when graduating to Hard will be the fact that the fast songs, like &#8220;Blitzkrieg Bop,&#8221; will start to have eighth notes on the hi-hat or ride cymbals. </p>

<p>Basically, your right hand (if you&#8217;re right handed) will have to play twice as fast. To get your hand speed up requires practice, plain and simple. </p>

<p>Practice making each stroke as relaxed as possible. Faster rolls and eighth-note rides mean using more of your fingers and wrist and less of your arm. Try rotating your hands so that your knuckles face upward &#8211; this will help you get in the mode of &#8220;thinking from the wrist.&#8221; </p>

<p>For small, fast strokes, you can flick the stick downward using just your middle, ring, and pinky fingers. For larger, broader strokes, you can used your more of your forearm muscles to flick your wrist downwards. </p>

<p>Ideally, you shouldn&#8217;t be using any muscles to bring the stick back to its starting point. The bouncing action of the pads should do that for you. Pay attention to your dominant hand, as its motion is probably going to look way better than your weak hand. It doesn&#8217;t hurt to watch your hands in a mirror to keep the weak hand in good form.</p>

<p>While practicing your bounce, you can start by playing a R L R L pattern, or L R L R for lefties. </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.wired.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/01/10/16_single_paradiddle.gif"><img width="87" height="53" border="0" src="http://blog.wired.com/games/images/2008/01/10/16_single_paradiddle.gif" title="16_single_paradiddle" alt="16_single_paradiddle" style="margin:0px 0px 5px 5px;float:right"></a>
If you want to work on getting comfortable with stranger patterns, try L R L L R L R R. This is one of many patterns, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradiddle">paradiddles</a>, that drummers use. (This particular one is called a "single paradiddle.")</p>

<p>Practicing paradiddles between different limbs helps you become more independent between those limbs. Although it is mainly useful to help train your left and right hands, paradiddles can also be helpful in training your feet. Try tapping your foot on every beat for extra limb independence. Or try the song "Vasoline," where the expert drum pattern is the aforementioned paradiddle, but between the snare and kick drums, with the hats keeping time.</p>

<p>In short, learning limb independence is a can of worms, and there are a lot of ways to approach it. Since we don&#8217;t want to get into reading sheet music or tablatures, you can make up your own challenges and paradiddles. For instance, if you are a Medium player, you surely know how to play a basic rock back beat on the pads, pillows, steering wheel, what have you. Try reversing your hands, so that your snare hand keeps the time on eighth notes, and your hi-hat hand plays the back beat. Or make your foot play the back beat &#8211; as long as you stick with it, play it for a minute or two at a time, and try it at a variety of tempos.</p>

<p><strong>More Practice Tips</strong></p>

<p>Practicing making fluid, efficient strokes in front of a mirror is a good way to get good form, which will lead to increased speed. Once you have that down, you can improve your speed and consistency by playing to a metronome. You can get cheap ones for around $25, or you could just use an Internet application like <a href="http://www.metronomeonline.com">Metronome Online</a>. Or you could find songs in a variety of tempos and just practice to them.</p>

<p>Start out slow -- say, 90 BPM -- and play a 16th note roll (think the drum intro to &#8220;Wipeout&#8221;). Or play a regular rock back beat with your two hands and the pedal. See if you can keep that up using your best form for a minute straight. </p>

<p>Then take it up to, say, 110 or 120 BPM, and do it again for another minute. Eventually you will be able to get up to 180 BPM and beyond, and playing to the metronome will ensure that you have the inner sense of tempo and groove to keep you locked in with the in-game songs.</p>

<p>One more thing you could work on is moving around the kit. Try playing 16th note rolls moving across all four pads from left to right, which is how most tom-tom fills go (as in &#8220;Run to the Hills"). Reverse that if you're a left-hand player. A trickier feat is to play the opposite direction, like right to left if you&#8217;re a righty, without hitting your sticks together.</p>

<p>You should also familiarize yourself with playing in triple time or swing time, as in &#8220;Detroit Rock City&#8221; or the intro to &#8220;Foreplay/Long Time,&#8221; where gems come in threes, sixes, etc. You can do the exercises mentioned above in triple time as well. &#8220;In Bloom&#8221; on Expert has some slow fills that are triplets, so if you can nail those, you know you can go between the two different feels easily.</p>

<p><strong>Further Reading</strong></p>

<p>The internet, especially YouTube, can be a great resource for folks who can&#8217;t afford or a drum instructor. Look up keywords like &#8220;Bass drum technique,&#8221; &#8220;Heel Up,&#8221; &#8220;Heel Down,&#8221; &#8220;Paradiddle,&#8221; or &#8220;Stick Technique.&#8221; </p>

<p>You might also try looking for DVDs or online content featuring the drummer from your favorite band.</p>

<p>And just for fun, look this up on YouTube: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=e7TzWrKso4I">WFD - Mike Mangini - World Record</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Songs To Try</strong></p>

<p>Each song has a different pattern, which means that some songs are better for practicing certain techniques than others. Here are some you might want to try.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go With The Flow&#8221; and &#8220;Paranoid&#8221; on Expert have simple hand patterns, but some fast pedal work to test your foot stamina.</p>

<p>&#8220;Orange Crush&#8221; and &#8220;The Hand That Feeds&#8221; (Hard and Expert) have sections with some fun off beat stuff on the right hand, which will test your limb independence. With &#8220;Orange Crush,&#8221; on Expert, you can also practice your 16th notes at a less breakneck pace than &#8220;Run to the Hills&#8221;</p>

<p>Try playing &#8220;29 Fingers&#8221; while tapping your right foot. (On the floor, not the pedal!) This is an example of forcing different limbs to play different parts of the beat. In this song, the right hand acts as the bass drum. Pretend your foot is a cymbal, and tap along.</p>

<p>If you want to perfect your bounce, try to tackle &#8220;Run to the Hills&#8221; on Expert. This song requires incredible speed, accuracy, and stamina, so you&#8217;ll really need to be using smaller, relaxed strokes.</p>

social animals, human beings tend to allow their better judgement to be
stampeded by the crowd&#39;s impulses. This applies not only to the
followers of trends, but their critics: the bigger the icon, the bigger
the kudos accorded those who accomplish its takedown.This is only aided
by the ephemeral nature of popularity: both sides to laud&#8211;or
criticise&#8211;things based on their aura rather than the true nature of the
thing itself.</p>





<p>A recent example of this is the Moleskine notebook. Produced by the
Italian company Modo e Modo, Moleskines are essentially copies of a
French design. Their advertising copy links them to a number of
literary and artistic luminaries: Hemingway, Chatwin, Picasso. Since
all of these people are dead, they can&#39;t complain that they never, in
fact, used the notebooks in question, although they may well have used
very similar ones (Chatwin certainly did; his were purchased from a
Parisian stationer, until the supplier closed down in 1986).</p>



<p>This
is really where the trouble starts. Coupled with their good looks (the
Moleskine is a very attractive notebook), the cachet of the artists and
writers essentially providing endorsements for them gave Moleskine
notebooks the jumpstart they needed. It&#39;s important to note that the
kind of person who will spend time looking for the perfect notebook is
generally the classic &quot;early adopter&quot; so beloved of computer technology
companies, and I suspect they (we) are perhaps more vulnerable to the
lure of the Moleskine&#39;s whispered promises.&quot;Buy me,&quot; it seems to say,
&quot;and you too can be inspired to write like Hemingway.&quot;<em> <br></em></p>

<p>Marketing does not fool us, exactly; it hands us the lines
we feed ourselves. Seduction is something we allow to happen, and investing objects
with mysterious power is an old trap. We want to believe that possessing these
items is what will give us power, or wealth, or inspiration; we want to deny
that &#39;genius&#39; is a label we apply to those who are both supremely gifted and
work harder than anyone else. Olympic athletes have a genetic makeup that makes
them suited for their chosen sport, but this is at best a starting point;
potential will always go unfulfilled unless it is accompanied by a daily grind of
back-breaking labour. Nobody wants to hear this; it&#39;s not a cheering message.
The idea that we simply lack some talisman, owned by those whose powers we aspire
to possess, is a far more attractive one.</p>
		</div>
					
			<div>
				<p>The story so far: early adopters are drawn in by a combination of factors, one
of which is the mystique evoked by Modo e Modo&#39;s marketing copy; the cult of
the Moleskine grows, and they begin to crop up in a multitude of stationery,
art and book shops, helped along by distribution agreements with several major
chain bookstores (Barnes and Noble, Waterstone&#39;s). Enter the critics, with the
message that Moleskine fans are clearly being taken for the proverbial ride, Hemingway
and Chatwin never bought Modo e Modo products, and that the talismanic
qualities that are (implicitly or explicitly) being appealed to do not, in fact, exist.</p></div></div></div>
		

					
			
				
<p>
Several lines of argument appear in response to such sceptical claims; I do not
claim any of them as my own, merely hoping to summarise the main position.</p>


<p>
f1) They&#39;re just good notebooks, better than anything else on the
market; yes, you pay a premium for them, but it&#39;s worth it to have the
best.</p>


<p>
f2) The talismanic qualities do exist; I write more and better in my Moleskine
than I did before. Of course, the Moleskine only serves to evoke this response
in me&#8211;it isn&#39;t some kind of immaterial power residing in the notebook
itself&#8211;but if the effect is real, surely the end result is the same.</p>


<p>
f3) I just like them, it&#39;s a personal aesthetic preference. I don&#39;t deny the
marketing argument, but you have no basis for criticism as far as subjective
preference goes.

</p>


<p>There isn&#39;t much consensus on f1; some think that there are better notebooks, or
cheaper notebooks that are just as good. Many don&#39;t. Personally I haven&#39;t found
any that are both as well made and suit my personal needs as perfectly, and I
suspect many of those needs generalise well. Briefly, the pocket Moleskines are compact, with a high page
count for their size, and good paper (albeit with well-documented feathering
and bleed issues; you need to choose your pen carefully). They are stitched and
bound in oilskin-covered card, which makes them resilient. Lastly, they have several nice touches that make
them stand out from the crowd. The built-in bookmark and elastic snap that
keeps it closed while not in use are of obvious utility; the back pocket grows
on one. I use mine to carry library photocopier cards and Post-it notes.<br>
<br>
The second argument is trickier. Merlin Mann calls the Moleskine a MacGuffin,
which seems to have a certain truth to it. However, speaking of the Moleskine
in these terms does it something of a disservice, and does not tell the whole
story by any means. On the one hand, it may draw out certain good behaviours in
some people: writing more, writing better. The Moleskine, when evoking these
tendencies, helps define an ideal we aspire to (it may do this by instantiating
a certain ideal itself, that of the ideal notebook, or at least coming closer
than other notebooks).<br>
<br>
As portentous as this sounds, it is only one side of the truth; the downside is
that a Moleskine can inhibit as much as inspire. By declaring this ideal of
good writing, it poses a challenge&#8211;or an obstacle. If one is constantly
second-guessing oneself, worrying about whether what one is writing is in some way &#39;worthy&#39; of being written down in a
Moleskine, then it is that much harder to write anything. The loudest voices
may be of those trumpeting their new muse, but it may simply be that those who
find the Moleskine a mental burden do not exist; perhaps they are ashamed of
their failings, or simply don&#39;t recognise the syndrome.<br>
<br>
Having suffered from this problem myself, I suspect that which side of
the fence
one falls on is due to temperament, and how one views one&#39;s writing.
When I
initially purchased a Moleskine, several years ago, I wrote fairly
prolifically
about a story I was trying to write, but I didn&#39;t get much of the story
itself
written. Entering a period of greater depression, my doubts assailed me
with
more vigour, and my writing petered out. Whenever I did try to write, I
had to
use simple sheets of lined paper; if I sat down with my Moleskine, I
would
stare at the empty page, trying to think of something worthwhile to
write. As
my condition improved, I began writing more often in the Moleskine, and
now I write in it at least every couple of days. Many of the posts on
this
blog began life as musings in my Moleskine.<br>
<br>
There is a third point, of course, which is that whatever the Moleskine is, it
is not simply a talismanic object. It is, in fact, a notebook&#8211;and rather a good
one at that. In my initial paragraph I warned against the seductive nature of
the aura surrounding a fashionable object, and here we can see that warning
realised. The fan claims that the Moleskine helps them write more, and better;
the critic responds that in many cases, using a Moleskine may actually hinder
the writing process. All this does is polarise the debate: what we should be doing is looking at how these claims really relate to an individual
choice (that is to say, whether or not they buy one, if they&#39;re thinking about
doing so). I don&#39;t mean to claim that a given transaction (or the set of all
such transactions) is the only thing that gives this argument meaning, but it
is certainly an important nexus of it.<br>
<br>
What do I mean by this? Well, to begin with, the decision puts these arguments
in a context, relates them to behaviour, and generally provides some
much-needed perspective. The question of how an individual&#39;s writing will be
affected by using a Moleskine is an individual one: it depends on their
circumstances, their nature. Moreover, there are practical questions: is this
the right kind of notebook for me? What does it do better than the rest? Is the
price worth it? These issues depend on the individual, on the context in which
the questions are asked, not on spurious normative claims. The hard work of
answering a question is done once the terms of the question and the context in
which it is being asked are defined closely enough.<br>
<br>
These questions of individual circumstance bring us to the third argument.
Essentially, it grows from a confusion about subjectivity: the word
&#39;subjective&#39; is used as a shorthand to mean &quot;circumstances specific to
me&quot;. When someone says that buying a Moleskine is &quot;A personal preference&quot;, or &quot;A subjective judgment&quot;, what they
really mean is &quot;It suits my needs, but not necessarily yours.&quot; This
isn&#39;t what it really means for something to be subjective: the circumstances on
which the choice is based are in fact objective facts; if you were in their
position, you would make a different choice. There probably is an element of
subjective aesthetic appreciation, but I think that if it exists (this is a
point of philosophical contention) its influence is overrated.<br>
<br>
I have several Moleskines in current operation: a sketchbook, some Cahiers for ultimate portability and throwaway scribbles, and a lined notebook
in which I write&#8230; well, pretty much whatever I feel like. A couple of months
ago I wrote the following in it:<br>
<br>
&quot;Decided that too much sanctity is stifling me. Need to loosen up.
Consequently, this notebook will loosen up&#8212;starting with some Post-it artwork.
The Moleskine crazy is apparently, just like the iPod, big. Now I&#39;m just one of
the crowd. Still, nice to be an early adopter for once, even if I haven&#39;t
written in it as much as I might (I put this down to the aforementioned desire
not to violate such a beautiful notebook with incessant and unremarkable
scribbling).&quot;<br>
<br>
Post-its are another good way of avoiding this problem; I draw on them, badly,
then stick the good ones in the Moleskine. However, I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s high time
I did more of it&#8212;so I bought a Moleskine Sketchbook. We&#39;ll see how it goes.</p>

      <dd>&#8220;Let&#8217;s put it straight &#8211; simplicity is more complex than you probably think it is. To design a web-site in user-friendly tones, presenting all information and removing unnecessary details isn&#8217;t easy. In fact, many designers don&#8217;t manage to find the right mix between details and their presentation on the screen, which usually results in an information overkill and/or decreased usability. However, some designers do manage to find the right balance and create usable, elegant and clean web-sites with simple layouts. We&#8217;ve selected some of them.&#8221;</dd>

      <dd>&#8220;Even the iPhone&#8217;s hardware and software teams were kept apart: Hardware engineers worked on circuitry that was loaded with fake software, while software engineers worked off circuit boards sitting in wooden boxes. By January 2007, when Jobs announced the iPhone at Macworld, only 30 or so of the most senior people on the project had seen it.&#8221;</dd>

      <dd>&#8220;For scrolling through menus and adjusting volume, the iPhone&#8217;s new UI methods are, <span>IMHO</span>, superior to the old iPod&#8217;s wheel. But the &#8220;jog dial&#8221; is still the ideal user interface for arbitrary positioning the playhead in audio and video tracks. It&#8217;s a hardware solution that has been in professional and consumer use for decades.&#8221;</dd>

The future of marketing (at least the big successes) is going to be fueled by those with the guts to embrace the masses. The profits, at least in the short run, may well be found by those that embrace exclusion.&#8221;</dd>

Relax.  To avoid burnout, self improvement weblog Zen Habits suggest that you slow down.  Right now.  If you&#39;re mind is constantly spinning with ideas, thoughts, or deadlines, you initially don&#39;t want to expect immediate gratification.  Resolve to take baby steps.  Start imagining the next few days without any distractions and work obligations.  Envision a day where all you were doing was dedicating the day to yourself.   Eventually, turn those thoughts into reality&#8212;slowly.  Spend time with yourself for an hour a day.  Don&#39;t rush to finish the food off your plate.   </p><p>Try to maintain a sense of calmness even in difficult situations.  Slow down your attention span: listen more and respond slowly.  Ignore distractions, for example, when you're driving.  Instead, focus on the road and the surroundings.  By slowing down when necessary, you'll reap many benefits.  You'll feel better about yourself, appreciate your surroundings, and enjoy life a whole lot more.<br>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p><img src="http://www.wearethepostmen.com/wp-content/uploads//2008/01/patforde.jpg" alt="patforde.jpg" align="right">A bit of  a self-referential plug here: we &#8212; and when I saw we, I mean Big A &#8212; was able to <a href="http://www.insidethehall.com/2008/01/16/interview-pat-forde/">wrangle in Pat Forde for an interview</a> over at our other home, Inside the Hall. Amongst the obvious Hoosier talk, he also dropped some knowledge on blogs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blogs are definitely having an effect. I welcome all attempts to modernize our industry; the good innovations will stay and the bad ones will eventually disappear. Blogs are here to stay and definitely have some positive aspects, in terms of giving people more information, more points of view, and more access to topics of interest.</p>
<p>Since I am an old-school newspaper guy, I do have some issues with blogs as they exist today. First, how many bloggers actually report news themselves? Do they throw rumors at the cyberwall and hope one or two stick? Do they simply repeat other people&#8217;s gossip? Do they know how to conduct interviews? (Props to you all for at least reaching out and asking questions.) And if they don&#8217;t report news independently, where would they be without the mainstream journalists who do? What I don&#8217;t like are blogs that exist simply to snipe at mainstream media that does the heavy lifting of reporting the news.</p>
<p>Also: While I support everyone&#8217;s right to sound off on public affairs and events, I don&#8217;t find a lot of it interesting or entertaining. Everyone wants to be Bill Simmons, but to my knowledge there&#8217;s only one him. Two hundred thousand bloggers cracking wise from their living room in their underwear all want to be the next Simmons, but how many of them are being paid (handsomely) to do it?</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s become an increasing epidemic amongst sports bloggers is to ardently attack any MSM guy that showers even a tiny bit of negativity on the blogosphere. And while I certainly understand why bloggers do so, it&#8217;s also important to note that Forde isn&#8217;t necessarily wrong here. Blogs, in a large sense, piggyback on the work of guys that are out on the grind everyday; there&#8217;s certainly reason to be dubious of some blogs out there. The blogosphere can&#8217;t be 100 percent awesome and powerful and way better than MSM, but it is doing some solid, entertaining work.</p>
<p>Also: this underwear stereotype is getting <em>old</em>. And no,  I don&#8217;t want to be the next Bill Simmons.  That involves me watching far too many Celtics games.</p></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<blockquote><p>I've had Alex Trebek rap Snoop Dogg's "Gin and Juice" -- he had his mind on his money and his money on his mind that day. Did a category called "Death and Texas" just because I liked the title (and finding stuff about people dying and/or getting killed in Texas turned out to be remarkably easy). I've learned about Jean Sibelius, and word to the wise, if you see "blah blah blah this Finnish composer blah blah blah...", Jean Sibelius might not be your worst guess. Well, at least if I wrote it. I'm just not that up on my Finnish composers.</p></blockquote>

Alien? The Ceti Eel wrapping around your brain stem? Feh. The best sci-fi creatures ever have nothing on these <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15816_5-most-horrifying-bugs-in-world.html">5 most horrifying bugs in the world</a>. Coming via Cracked.com, it is irreverent and the language is not kid-friendly, but it is funny and scary at the same time.</p>

<p>The typical bugs you know about are here, like the Africanized honey bee and the soldier ant. But what really freaked me out was learning that H.R.R. Geiger&#39;s Alien has a natural equivalent: Vespa japonica or the Japanese hornet.</p><blockquote><p>Why you must fear it: It&#39;s the size of your thumb and it can spray flesh-melting poison. We really wish we were making that up for, you know, dramatic effect because [bleep], what a terrible thing a three-inch acid-shooting hornet would be, you know? Oh, hey, did we mention it shoots it into your eyes? Or that the poison also has a pheromone cocktail in it that&#39;ll call every hornet in the hive to come over and sting you until you are no longer alive?</p></blockquote><p>Ouch. For full effect, here is a video clip of the beast in action.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure about anyone else but, with few exceptions, sci-fi monsters have always disappointed me. It always seems like designers avoid the obvious sources for the most disgusting, horrifyingly ugly, and dangerous creatures: nature itself.

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p><img align="left" src="http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/files/2008/01/lesbian_kiss.jpg" width="124" height="116"><i>Time</i> magazine has a couple of articles on the psychology of love, sex and attraction. The <a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1704355-1,00.html">first</a> looks at the science of love, from thoughts to hormones, and the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1704684,00.html">second</a> at what we know about flirting.</p>

<p>The love article is a more in-depth look at the topic of the two articles, and touches on studies that have taken place everywhere from the delivery room to the brain scanner.</p>

<p>It's a little basic in places (e.g. it uses the dopamine = reward line a little uncritically), but is otherwise an interesting read.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A deep voice, also testosterone driven, can have similarly seductive power. Psychology professor David Feinberg of McMaster University in Ontario <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17895219">studied</a> [<a href="http://www.voiceresearch.org/apicella,%20feinberg,%20marlowe%202007.pdf">pdf</a>] Tanzania's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadza_people">Hadza</a> tribesmen, one of the world's last hunter-gatherer communities, and found that the richer and lower a man's voice, the more children he had. Researchers at the University of Albany recently conducted related research [<a href="http://www.scienceandsex.com/images/Voiceattractiveness_Paper.pdf">pdf</a>] in which they had a sample group of 149 volunteers listen to recordings of men's and women's voices and then rate the way they sound on a scale from "very unattractive" to "very attractive." On the whole, the people whose voices scored high on attractiveness also had physical features considered sexually appealing, such as broad shoulders in men and a low waist-to-hip ratio in women.</p>

<p>This suggests either that an alluring voice is part of a suite of sexual qualities that come bundled together or that simply knowing you look appealing encourages you to develop a voice to match. Causation and mere correlation often get muddied in studies like this, but either way, a sexy voice at least appears to sell the goods. "It might convey subtle information about body configuration and sexual behavior," says psychologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_G._Gallup">Gordon Gallup</a>, who co-authored the study.<br>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The flirting article is, rather predictably, a bit more light-hearted and largely talks about theories rather than evidence.</p>

<p>You're probably better off trying your luck with the <a href="http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html">guide</a> to flirting from the <i>Social Issues Research Centre</i> that looks at what sociology can tell us about being playfully alluring.</p>

<p>Whoa!  Boggling, bizarre and beautiful, the creatures evolving in the remote depths of the world's oceans really are a trip. This book's crisp close-ups allow astounding detail to pop out from the blackness: gorgeous mugshots of translucent octopi, technicolor jelly fish, and feathery pink iceworms (also seen in the previously-reviewed <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000233.php">Ecology of the Deep Sea Vents</a>). I missed the book when it came out last spring; I'm thrilled it didn't pass me by any longer than it did. Seventy years ago, explorer William Beebe put it this way: "Anyone who has actually seen this universe will keep an image of it in his memory forever; for its isolation, its cosmic cold, its eternal obscurity -- and above all, for the indescribable beauty of the denizens of those regions." Amen.</p>
