<div class='item'><span class='itemorigin clearfix span8' id = 'item20'><a href='http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking'>The Pioneer Woman Cooks!</a> : ameritrash's shared items <br></br> 08/16/2008 11:03 PM</span><span class='itemtitle em'><a href = 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pwcooks/~3/361906126/'>Crispy Yogurt Chicken</a></span>
<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>I love chicken legs. So does Marlboro Man. So do the punks. This means I&#8217;m always looking for new and interesting ways to cook them, since I&#8217;ve fried so many chicken legs in my life, I could fuel Airforce One for a year with the leftover oil. Plus, although fried chicken is delicious, I get a little tired of it. I do! Don&#8217;t tell Marlboro Man or Colonel Sanders, okay? I don&#8217;t mean no disrespect.</p>
<p>This is a yummy, quick way to spruce up chicken, and considering I threw the dish together with ingredients I already had on hand (translation: I had no food and was scouring the pantry and fridge for something warm and hot to fix for my ravenous family) it turned out beautifully. The two key ingredients are plain, unflavored yogurt&#8212;an ingredient I&#8217;ve started using more and more in my cooking lately&#8212;and Panko bread crumbs. Panko bread crumbs, if you&#8217;ve never tried them, are just delightful: extremely light and crispy and wonderful. And while I used to have to order Panko bread crumbs by mail back when I started using them in 2002, these days they can be found all over the place in most supermarkets&#8212;even <em>The Wal Marts</em>, for Pete&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>The fact that I actually remember the year I started using Panko bread crumbs should give you some idea as to why I can&#8217;t remember my grandmother&#8217;s birthday or important things I have to mail. My mind is filled with useless, irrelevant facts, facts like the exact time in history I began using breading ingredients. </p>

Let us observe a moment of silence for the beauty that plain, unflavored yogurt has brought to our lives.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751587264/" title="DSC_0090_3275 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/2751587264_b47f315a49_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0090_3275" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Butter, too. Let&#8217;s not forget its humanitarian contributions.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751588888/" title="DSC_0093_3278 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3290/2751588888_c44d94511c_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0093_3278" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Oh! It wouldn&#8217;t be a Cast of Characters without my actually forgetting one of the characters, would it? Parsley. Fresh Parsley. Here it is, in all its verdant greenness. </p>
<p>I know &#8220;verdant greenness&#8221; is criminally redundant, but just work with me here.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750756161/" title="DSC_0097_3282 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2200/2750756161_da0c600643_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0097_3282" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Begin by throwing 2 cups of plain yogurt into a mixing bowl.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751591990/" title="DSC_0102_3287 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3249/2751591990_586310b0c4_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0102_3287" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Now peel a couple of cloves of garlic&#8230;</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750758847/" title="DSC_0104_3289 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3055/2750758847_8955d3f0b9_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0104_3289" height="332" width="500"></a></span></p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750759455/" title="DSC_0105_3290 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3216/2750759455_b0c1c6e3b6_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0105_3290" height="332" width="500"></a></span>And mince them very finely. </p>
<p>Now throw the garlic in with the yogurt.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751596470/" title="DSC_0113_3298 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3159/2751596470_bc0fe0bf62_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0113_3298" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Before.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750763475/" title="DSC_0116_3301 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3129/2750763475_c968465996_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0116_3301" height="332" width="500"></a></span>After.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751594094/" title="DSC_0106_3291 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3025/2751594094_d973b04494_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0106_3291" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Now grab some parsley. It gives a nice, fresh flavor to the chicken. You can experiment with different herbs/seasonings here. It won&#8217;t hurt my feelings.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751594804/" title="DSC_0107_3292 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3285/2751594804_b1648ac0ce_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0107_3292" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Chop the parsley finely.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750764003/" title="DSC_0119_3304 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3076/2750764003_cf99f2da56_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0119_3304" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Then throw it into the yogurt.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751598670/" title="DSC_0120_3305 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3024/2751598670_deaf771ce8_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0120_3305" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Give the mixture a little stir.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751595316/" title="DSC_0109_3294 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2208/2751595316_1361493b21_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0109_3294" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Now cut a lemon in half.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751595794/" title="DSC_0111_3296 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3206/2751595794_99ea11fcc4_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0111_3296" height="332" width="500"></a></span></p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751603748/" title="DSC_0129_3314 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3074/2751603748_6d362a8aab_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0129_3314" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Then squeeze in the juice, stirring well to combine.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750757327/" title="DSC_0101_3286 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3156/2750757327_ff2fb0bba1_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0101_3286" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Now go thoroughly rinse the chicken, and salt it well. And if you don&#8217;t have Kosher salt in your kitchen, buy it today! It&#8217;s Morton&#8217;s&#8230;in the salt aisle. And it&#8217;s very, very forgiving.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750767547/" title="DSC_0124_3309 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/2750767547_ea0a1290b6_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0124_3309" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Pour some Panko breadcrumbs into a second bowl. I start with about 2 cups.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750768515/" title="DSC_0125_3310 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3132/2750768515_5d554826d1_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0125_3310" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Salt the breadcrumbs just to give them a little more flavor.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751602912/" title="DSC_0126_3311 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3261/2751602912_ac4c1d1775_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0126_3311" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Now, in final preparation for our landing, go ahead and butter a baking dish. <em>Everything&#8217;s better with a little smear of butter</em>: Don&#8217;t you ever forget that.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750770629/" title="DSC_0131_3316 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3138/2750770629_d4bc6e524c_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0131_3316" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Now it&#8217;s time to make the chicken, baby! First, place the chicken, one at a time, into the yogurt mixture. Turn it over to thoroughly coat&#8230;</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751605654/" title="DSC_0133_3318 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/2751605654_4c41e9c43b_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0133_3318" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Then roll in the Panko breadcrumbs. </p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750772943/" title="DSC_0134_3319 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3207/2750772943_fd618f0d2c_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0134_3319" height="332" width="500"></a></span>They&#8217;ll adhere really well&#8212;just make sure to coat all the areas of the chicken thoroughly. </p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750773775/" title="DSC_0136_3321 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/2750773775_c3eb8cb143_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0136_3321" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Repeat until all the chicken is breaded&#8230;</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750774551/" title="DSC_0138_3323 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3036/2750774551_aca096146e_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0138_3323" height="332" width="500"></a></span>&#8230;And place in the buttered baking dish. </p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2750775157/" title="DSC_0139_3324 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3273/2750775157_cbce5cc379_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0139_3324" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Then, place a slice of butter over the large part of the chicken. <em><strong>This is a very important step</strong></em>, as the Panko breadcrumbs tend to get pretty dry without the moisture of the butter.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751609858/" title="DSC_0140_3325 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3065/2751609858_e6ae43900d_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0140_3325" height="332" width="500"></a></span>I look for whatever butter rationale I can find in my daily life. It&#8217;s a hobby of mine.</p>
<p>Now cover in foil and bake at <strong>350 degrees for 1 hour</strong>, removing foil for the last 15 minutes to allow it to get nice and golden. I actually had to bake mine for almost 1 hour 15 minutes this time, so be prepared to keep going until it&#8217;s nice and golden and sizzling. You&#8217;ll want the breading on the underside of the chicken not to be soft and mushy, so pay attention to it.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751580586/" title="DSC_0003_3429 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3078/2751580586_834866cf6a_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0003_3429" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Mmmm. It&#8217;s ready. It&#8217;s no fried chicken, but it&#8217;s a really nice, light substitute. Instead of the buttermilk, egg, and flour mixture I use to coat my fried chicken, this chicken&#8217;s breading is nothing more than yogurt and very light breadcrumbs. It just feels good goin&#8217; down! Serve it with a big, green salad with <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2008/06/homemade-ranch-dressing/">Homemade Ranch Dressing</a>, and your family will give you a pedicure right after dinner. I promise.</p>
<p>&#160;<br>
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/2751581668/" title="DSC_0005_3431 by Pioneer  Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3059/2751581668_2fe2135e5f_o.jpg" alt="DSC_0005_3431" height="332" width="500"></a></span>Try it this week! (Oh, and don&#8217;t forget to eat the crispy, brown bits from the bottom of the baking pan.)</p>
<p>(Crispy, brown bits are my life.)</p>

The settlement charges that Airborne did not have adequate evidence to support its advertising claims. "There is no credible evidence that Airborne products, taken as directed, will reduce the severity or duration of colds, or provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places," said Lydia Parnes, Director of the FTC&#8217;s Bureau of Consumer Protection. </p>

<p>We've been skeptical of Airborne's claims since 2006, when we cautioned consumers to think twice before using the products.

You can get decent photos out of a standard, consumer-grade digital camera, but a little post-processing can turn them into fantastic wide-angle landscapes. You don't need to be one of those people who can explain the concept of lateral chromatic aberration to get truly eye-catching digital pictures. With a few shutter clicks and some free, cross-platform software, you can easily mesh standard digi-cam shots into true landscapes, fix one photo's deficiencies with another, and create layered photo collages. Let's take a look at how to use the free, open source application <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a> to make two basic kinds of panoramas.</p>


<h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px">What you'll need</h3>
<ul>
<li>A digital camera that embeds EXIF data in its pictures (that's basically all of them)</li>
<li>A <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/download/">copy of Hugin</a> (available for Windows, Mac, and Linux). If you're on Windows or Linux, you should also grab a copy of the <a href="http://autopano.kolor.com/">AutoPano tools</a>; Mac OS X users should have AutoPano tools built in. Follow the instructions at the Hugin site to install your copy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px">What you'll get</h3>
Here's an example of the kind of photo you'll get from this process. Even though I shot this three-frame scene at Niagara Falls (from the U.S. side) in automatic mode, it still came out pretty spiffy, if I do say so myself. (Click for a larger version.) <a href="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/nf_forLH.jpg.php"><img src="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/nf_forLH.jpg-thumb.jpg" style="display:block;float:none" height="280" width="800"></a> Now let's get started making your panorama.
<h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px">Shooting for panoramas</h3>
With Hugin's software, you can blend two side-by-side photos together, or you can cram 138 multi-angle Grand Canyon shots into one mega-vista. Whatever your project, here are some guides and tips on how to shoot to best take advantage of Hugin&#8212;and most any panorama-stitching software.
<ul>
<li><img alt="awb.jpg" src="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/awb.jpg" height="118" width="179"></li>
<li><strong>Use consistent settings</strong>&#8212;If possible, change your "white balance" to a manual mode and set it to a plainly white or gray spot; if not, at least change from "auto white-balancing" to an another setting that works. Better still, if you can set exposure to manual, meter it for the brightest or most average spot in the scene. Neither is a requirement, but they'll help your finished product blend more evenly.</li>
<li><strong>Choose a center point</strong>&#8212;Find the feature or area you think would look good in the center and take steady aim, at the same zoom level you'll shoot the rest. It'll help you align your pictures later and ensure you've got space to build on.</li>
<li><img alt="overlap.jpg" src="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/overlap.jpg" height="102" width="179"></li>
<li><strong>Shoot overlapping shots in ordered rows</strong>&#8212;If you're going for a horizontal-only panorama, go left to right, in a steady row, with 20-30 percent of the picture overlapping the last one, then do the same for higher or lower rows. Not only does it help you keep your shots organized, it counters the sometimes fuzzy or unfocused data many consumer cameras get at their exposure edges.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px">First steps: Merge a few pictures</h3>
We'll start simple, with two, three, or four pictures, shot in horizontal order. Load up Hugin, and you'll notice a series of tabs. Hit the "Load Images" button on the first "Assistant" tab, select your pics, and hit "Open." First-timers might get a prompt asking them to locate an AutoPano program&#8212;go ahead and point inside the folder you downloaded, but don't worry if you don't have it. Ignore the "Panorama Preview" that pops up and head for the second tab, "Images."
<p><img alt="lensstuff_cropped.jpg" src="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/lensstuff_cropped.jpg" height="129" width="242">Remember that center image we took? Find it in the list, then hit the "<strong>Anchor this image for position</strong>" button, and, assuming it's a well-lit shot, "<strong>Anchor this image for exposure</strong>.&quot; Next up is an optional step, for those who know a fair deal about their camera&#8212;head to the &quot;Camera &amp; Lens&quot; tab, click on the center image, and fill in what you know about your gear&#39;s degrees of view, focal length, color offsets, and other photo-pro stuff. You can save your information here for future panoramas. Once you&#39;re done (or lost), let&#39;s head to the meaty stuff at the &quot;Control Points&quot; tab.</p>
<p>You'll see two panels here, each set (at first) to display the same picture. Click the "1" tab on the right-hand panel, and you'll see your overlapping pictures. If AutoPano launched when you loaded your pics, you'll also see a good number of colored dots on the photo. Those are our "Control Points," spots that appear in both frames that Hugin uses to align and combine them. <img alt="bad_control_points.jpg" src="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/bad_control_points.jpg" height="95" width="180">AutoPano does a decent job sometimes, but it often picks out clouds, cars, blown branches and other moveable objects, which doesn't help anything. For a seamless meld, I wipe out the automatic points (select the first in the list at bottom and jam on the "delete" button on the right) and start fresh.</p>
<p>Zoom in on the photos (select "100%" or the like from the "View" menu in the lower-right) and move the sliders so you're looking at mostly overlapping areas. Find stable points that have a lot of contrast, such as building and window corners, road markings and signs&#8212;anything you're reasonably sure didn't move from one frame to the next. Repeat this process for each set of side-by-side frames. You only need a minimum of two pairs for each photo, but adding a few more ups Hugin's accuracy. Here's how I pinned the Niagara Falls (Ontario) skyline:<br>
<img src="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/control_points4.jpg" style="display:block;float:none" height="138" width="560"><br>
Click the "Optimizer" tab and, unless you want to get tweak-y, hitting the "Optimize now!" button, which starts lining up those Control Points and shifting photos around. <img alt="preview.jpg" src="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/preview.jpg" height="103" width="180">To see how Hugin did, hit the "Preview Panorama" menubar button, and you'll get a rough look at your creation. (It won't turn out exactly the same, but basically close). If it looks warped and off-base, you can head back and re-pin or add Control Points, move the crosshairs or use the "Center" and "Straighten" buttons in the preview mode to finesse it. Whenever you make any changes, however, head next to the Optimize tab and re-optimize&#8212;you can also change optimization settings to see if that nets any benefits.</p>
<p><img alt="stitch_settings3.jpg" src="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/stitch_settings3.jpg" height="492" width="215">We're almost there, seriously! If the preview looks decent, head finally to the "Stitcher" tab. The "Projection" setting is the heart of Hugin, telling the program how to bend and shape the output. For a few overlapping photos, "Equirectangular" usually provides the fullest view and best blend, but "Rectilnear" seems best when photos are tightly lined up. Hit "Calculate View of Field" next, keep the Quick Stitcher setting to "with custom settings below," and then hit "Calculate Optimal Size." The numbers will be ludicrously big, so knock one of them down to a standard size. Keep the stitching engine on "Nona," and make sure "Image output file" is "TIFF" and that "soft blending" is checked so the Enblend engine can work its stuff. Tell it where to save, and Hugin gets to work. If you're prompted to point to "Enblend," it's located in its own folder right inside Hugin's directory. Hugin will create temporary TIFF files and work your system pretty hard while it runs, which can take anywhere from seconds to a few minutes, depending on your system.</p>
<p>If the resulting image file is discolored in spots, it's likely due to camera settings or stark lighting differences, which, with only a few photos, can be fixed only in post-processing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px">Shooting full panoramas</h3>
If you followed the basic steps above, shooting and stitching a wider-angle panorama scene is much the same, with a few exceptions:
<ul>
<li><img alt="pana_glitch.jpg" src="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/pana_glitch.jpg" height="120" width="179"></li>
<li><strong>Shooting</strong>&#8212;If you're covering a wide area and shooting many more snaps, it's important to stay and pivot in one place and focus on keeping a 20-30% overlap. You'll also want to watch for inconsistencies like cars, pedestrians and other scenes that change, unless you're going for a more artistic paste-collage look</li>
<li><strong>AutoPano</strong>&#8212;You'll have to rely on this to create your Control Points, changing them only where you see problems in Preview or want finer control. Of course, you <em>can</em> line up matches for dozens of remarkably-similar pics by hand, but that's up to you.</li>
<li><strong>Frame pruning</strong>&#8212;If you've shot a lot of overlapping pictures and want to get rid of a phantom arm, half-car, or anything else, you can easily remove entire frames and likely not damage the scene. Head to the Preview window, click the numbered buttons to toggle frames on and off, hold the mouse on the button to get the file name, then head back to the "Images" tab and remove the file with the right-hand button.</li>
<li><strong>Stitching</strong>&#8212;Set the "Projection" setting to "Panorama" if you've covered a wide area, horizontal and vertical, or try other settings, like "Fish eye" for that "Paul's Boutique" look.</li>
</ul>
After just a little frame-pulling, and having shot with manually-controlled light, I got a panoramic streetscape (my third attempt) to come out pretty decent (click for larger view):<br>
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/ad_forLH.jpg.php"><img src="http://lifehacker.com/assets/resources/2008/04/ad_forLH.jpg-thumb.jpg" style="display:block;float:none" height="135" width="800"></a><br>
Once you've got the basics down, Hugin has much, much more for you to explore, including <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/tutorials/index.shtml">tutorials at the home page</a> that show you how to use the app with scanned documents, to create true 360-degree panoramas, and how to get real geeky with the settings.
<p>This is the method that worked most consistently for me with different sets of photos. I chose Hugin over previously-posted <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software//download-of-the-day-autostitch-101666.php">AutoStitch</a> for its cross-platform nature. But I want to hear how your own tips on how you work Hugin (or similar panorama-making apps) to make big, breathtaking scenes&#8212;with image links, naturally. Share your tips, questions and photo pride in the comments.</p>

Here's the latest installment in my ongoing series of photos from my travels: this amazing dress made from thrift-store suit-coats, seen yesterday at <a href="http://www.junkystyling.co.uk/">Junky Styling</a> in the Truman Brewery off Brick Lane in London. Junky has a knack for taking the most generic, bulk-available charity shop clothes and layering and mixing them to make the most extraordinary things. I have an overcoat from there that's so cool that people stop me on the street and ask me where I got it. We always stop in on a Sunday to see what's new there, and we're never disappointed: one week it's a ballgown made from Kiehl's Pharmacy aprons, the next it's a scarf made from the sleeves of an otherwise unlovely suit-coat.

<em>[image: Xeni Jardin, 2007, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">cc</a>]
</em></p><p>The government of Guatemala recently enacted a series of new laws intended to curb corruption within the country's $100 million adoption industry. Guatemala is one of the world's top "sender" countries for children adopted by US families, second only to China. Babies are big business there.
</p><p>
 This Central American nation is <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/gt.html">among the world's poorest</a>, and <a href="http://www.transparency.org/regional_pages/recrea/informacion_por_pais/guatemala">its legal system is among</a> the <a href="http://ushome.rediff.com/money/2003/oct/07corrupt.htm">world's most corrupt</a>. Add all of that up, factor in the social disruption that results from <a href="http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/report/english/toc.html">decades of civil war</a>, and you end up with a climate where babies are sometimes sold like animals and the rights of birth mothers are routinely abused. </p><p>

The Guatemalan government seems eager to make a punitive example out of one high-profile adoption agency in particular -- Casa Quivira. The country's biggest baby-bust yet broke this week, and involves two attorneys who represented that agency, which was once considered the most "legit" in the country. </p><p>The attorneys have been charged with fraud and human trafficking:


</p><blockquote>The probe of Casa Quivira &#8212; where 46 children in the process of being adopted by U.S. families were seized in a government raid last August &#8212; turned up a slew of irregularities, including at least five cases in which birth mothers were allegedly given false identities to avoid having to seek permission from family members and a judge to give up their babies.
<p>
Eighteen other mothers could not be found under the identities that case files provided, prosecutors said.
</p></blockquote>

<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080325/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/guatemala_adoptions;_ylt=ArWXcC3y6xushdQeuTJb_zdvaA8F">Link</a> to AP story, <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gIW67GSOP-zwIvoNj0Jo1M1TmWXwD8VBP0PG0">here's a related item</a> by the same reporter, about the same agency; <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/general/view.bg?articleid=1079330&amp;srvc=home&amp;position=recent">here's another</a>.<p>
I've spent a fair amount of time in Guatemala, since I was a teenager. I am familiar with first-person testimonies from a number of sides of this story: indigenous women who claim to have been robbed of their kids (or otherwise abused in the adoption process); attorneys and human rights workers who represent them; American families who began with the best of intentions but realized halfway through how corrupt the adoption system there really is. </p><p>
- - - - - - - - - - </p><p>
<strong>IMAGE</strong>:  I snapped this photo during a stealth visit to another adoption facility in Guatemala that has been described as a "baby-laundering" operation, run by an offshoot cell of a US-based evangelical megachurch. During this visit, they proudly told me they "cured" AIDS and HIV in some of these children through prayer to Jesus.

</p><p> The people who operate this agency obtain children from mostly indigenous, mostly displaced, all poor birth mothers; the agency is believed to routinely falsify or alter documentation, or change the names of children or parents, and arrange adoption transactions with US families as a source of income. </p><p>
 The children and teens there are locked in rooms when unsupervised, not allowed contact with family members who sometimes show up to reclaim them, and barbed wire fence rings the property perimeter. It felt like a prison.  </p><p>

Started over a decade ago by UK knitwear factory worker Phil Shaw, it requires four simple criteria: a man, an iron, an ironing board, and a crazy natural environment that makes people think, holy crap I can't believe he's ironing on that thing! Shaw calls extreme ironing "the latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well pressed shirt." <p>

I know it sounds silly, but some people take it very seriously, training for competitions by lifting irons like dumbbells and bench-pressing ironing boards. Not only do you have to have the stamina and athleticism to reach extreme conditions, but when you get there, you have to iron with finesse&#8212;it's a performance art, like dancing or gymnastics. Can you focus on a tiny crease in a shirt sleeve while balancing on one leg on a tree branch jutting out over a cliff? Didn't think so. </p><p>

The guy who runs Extreme Ironing Japan has promised to let me witness a session next time I'm there, so I'll let you guys know when that happens.  </p>

Here's a funny short video of Chinese people being exposed to fortune cookies (an American invention) for the first time:

<blockquote>
Americans find high emotional attachment to the slips inside their cookies, looking to them for winning lottery numbers and becoming upset when the fortunes inside are unfortunate. The Chinese, on the other hand, would often tell me after trying the curved vanilla-flavored wafers, &#8220;Americans are so strange, why are they putting pieces of paper in their cookies?&#8221;
</blockquote>
