<p><em>by Keith Robinson</em></p>

<p>People often ask me how I manage to consistently find time to do all the things I do.  Well, it's not rocket science but it doesn't just happen on its own either.  I've got quite a few tips, tricks and solutions that help me save time and ensure that my work/life balance is where it's supposed to be.</p>

<p>I wanted to take some time and share with you my own favorite timesavers and I'd love it if you could share yours with me.  Next week I'll follow up with my biggest time wasters.  Sometimes it's about knowing what not to do!</p>
<h4>Tivo</h4>

<p>I don't watch a whole lot of television, but like many of you, I do have a few shows I like to catch on a regular basis.  <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/tivo/index.php">Tivo</a> has been one of the biggest timesavers to come around in a long, long time.  It's ironic because of it's nature, but I find that now that I can record shows for viewing at my own choosing I actually watch much less.  Oh and fast-forwarding through commercials helps quite a bit too.</p>

<h4>The Printable CEO</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/productivity/biz-dev-help-with-the-printable-ceo-127495.php">The Printable CEO</a> is a newer addition to my bag of timesaving tricks.  It's a simple paper-based form that asks you "When is something worth doing?"  You can then rate your daily tasks and score them, giving you a nice snapshot of where you're spending your time throughout the week.  The default form is slanted toward a business development client/service relationship, but it's something you could easily edit and repurpose for your own work.</p>

<h4>Basecamp</h4>

<p>I'm a big fan of 37 Signal's <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/personal-organizers/manage-projects-online-with-basecamp-036040.php">Basecamp</a>.  It's the first project management tool that I've used for any length of time.  It's not perfect, and can't do everything, but what it can do is help you manage your time easily and keep track of all the loose bits you need for your projects.</p>  

<p>It's not hard to learn and could be adapted to almost any workflow.  I find that it helps free up my mind by keeping almost everything related to my projects in a secure, easily accessible place.  No longer do I have to hunt for files, or critical messages or my next action item.</p>

<h4>"Easy" Mode</h4>

<p>I'm a gamer and part of maintaining a good work/life balance means that I've got some time to play games.  However, I also know that games can eat up enormous amounts of time--so I play them on "easy" when possible.  I find that this cuts the total time I spend playing way down.</p>

<h4>Working From Home</h4>

<p>I'm actually working from home much less these days, but I do see that when I really need to get something done I can do that much easier, and in much less time, when I'm working from home away from distractions.</p>

<p>Of course, if you've got distractions at home that pull on your focus, this might not work well for you.  If you're looking for more productivity tips for working from home, <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/productivity/stay-productive-working-from-home-116183.php">you can start here.</a></p>

<h4>Your turn!</h4>

<p>Well, there are some of my favorites when it comes to saving time.  What're yours?</p>

You can find out the Yes/No/No-vote records by party, state, by legislator, by region (south vs midwest vs northeast), by baby-boomer status, by gender, and&#8230; wait for it&#8230; astrological sign! Take <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/109/house/1/votes/580/">H R 2419</a>, for example. The site <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/">lets you browse every vote in the U.S. Congress since 1991</a>.</p>

<p>Even more useful is the ability to subscribe to a legislator via RSS. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/o000167/">Barak Obama&#8217;s RSS feed</a>. When he casts a vote you&#8217;ll see it in your feed. Subscribe to yours today. Pretty damn useful I think.</p>

<p>Part of the brains behind this project is Chicagoan Adrian Holovaty. He&#8217;s also behind the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> web-app framework for Python and <a href="http://www.chicagocrime.org/">Chicagocrime.org</a>.

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>The explications continue.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I talked about how I&#8217;m using text files, and <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/11/21/qs-redux/">my post a while ago on Quicksilver appending</a>  reminded me of a few little changes I&#8217;ve made over the past year or so that my fellow text geeks might find interesting.</p>

<h3>Reviewing: Why text?</h3>

<p>Like a lot of geeks and aspirational geeks, I do as many things as possible in plain text files. I&#8217;ve endlessly sung the praises of text on 43F, but in a nutshell, they&#8217;re portable, efficient, tiny, and almost endlessly mungible. They&#8217;re the <em>lingua franca</em> of Unix and most of the civilized world.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;ll see, I use text files for any variety of things, although my favorite use is for making and maintaining lists. The <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/11/21/qs-redux/">aforementioned append functionality</a> lets me quickly add items to any file with nothing but muscle memory and a few keystrokes. Best thing ever.</p>

<p>I also <em>write</em> in text files as well as store large amounts of reference information. Text is very easy to swap into HTML (I keep almost everything in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> format), and text is wonderfully searchable, whether using Spotlight, Find &amp; Replace, or just via incremental search from within the editor.</p>

<p>Point being: I use applications like OmniOutliner, iCal, and (formerly) Entourage to organize the relationships between silos in my life; but text files are the living repositories for as much of the actual information as I can manage.</p>

<h3>Getting a system</h3>

<p>Like everything, this text system benefits from a loose organizational framework that lets me quickly create and change files without having to worry too much about what it&#8217;s called, where it goes, and how I&#8217;ll find it again. So here&#8217;s a few high points from my text world.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<h3>One and only one place</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve whittled down to a single folder for all my active text files with just two sub-directories, &#8220;Archives&#8221; and &#8220;Old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old&#8221; is simply where I dragged every text file I was pretty sure was dead or obviated (but you never know), and &#8220;Archives&#8221; is where I put the dearly-departed since making the move to the one folder to rule them all. Archiving is done&#8230;well&#8230;whenever I feel like it or notice that the top txt directory is starting to seem a little wooly.</p>

<p>Everything else sits in one directory. I use a little system of &#8220;meta symbols&#8221; and intuitive naming to keep things organized in the one big folder.</p>

<h3>A smart name</h3>

<p>Nearly all my files are named according to this structure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>Metasymbol SphereOfLife Project UniqueIntuitiveFilename VersionNumber.txt</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Metasymbol</strong> tells me whether the file is a running list, a reference file, or a static document (more on this in a minute)</li>
<li><strong>Sphere of Life</strong> is simply something like &#8220;work&#8221; or &#8220;home&#8221; or &#8220;43 folders&#8221; &#8212; any &#252;ber-silo that represents, say, 20% or more of your time and attention (hint: abbreviations are good here)</li>
<li><strong>Project</strong> is what it sounds like: &#8220;Make-Articles&#8221; or &#8220;Johns-Site&#8221; or whatever (hint: abbreviations are good here too)</li>
<li>The <strong>unique file name</strong> is the first and most intuitive name that pops into my head, sometimes augmented with redundant acronyms, etc. For me it&#8217;s important to be able to find stuff quickly in Quicksilver, so I leave big fat hooks that account for whatever I&#8217;m likely to be looking for in the future</li>
<li><strong>Version number</strong> is a slick little trick of mine. When I start a new version of a document, instead of adding a &#8220;2&#8243; or &#8220;3&#8243; to the most recent copy, I simply duplicate the document, then timestamp the <em>old</em> one &#8212; ala &#8220;<code>+ work haa site design proposal-2005-12-12_08-16-34.txt</code>&#8220;. That way I always know the <em>unversioned</em> copy is the most recent, but I still have backups I can roll back to any time. Neato.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Meta symbols</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve discovered I have three basic kinds of text files, and chose a simple method for marking the <em>type</em> of files they are for quick visual cueing.</p>

<p>This is <em>super helpful</em> for winnowing file names in Quicksilver: I start by typing one of these unusual (non-alpha-numeric) characters, and I can instantly pop to just a list of the <em>types</em> of files I want to see.</p>

<h4>Running lists</h4>

<p>Running lists are the majority of my files. They&#8217;re the kinds of lists that I mentioned in the appending article &#8212; ongoing places to park ideas of any kind over time. They begin with a &#8220;<strong>&gt;</strong>&#8220;. This is, as with all these, purely my own convention, so you should feel free to pick symbols that make sense for you. This yields file names like:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&gt; broken.txt</strong> - items or functionalities in my world that need repair or fixes</li>
<li><strong>&gt; mom birthday gift ideas.txt</strong> - ways to delight the one what brung me</li>
<li><strong>&gt; webdav wish list and questions.txt</strong> - little projects for my newfound favorite technology</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reference</h4>

<p>Reference items are evergreen and reusable content that I update fairly infrequently and refer to as needed.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>^ work resume.txt</strong> </li>
<li><strong>^ 43f site bio.txt</strong> </li>
<li><strong>^ work domains I&#8217;m not using.txt</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>Static files</h4>

<p>These are things like blog posts, articles, and any kind of nonce content that will be used once, and then probably not needed again (making them very quick to archive every month or so).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>+ 43f post new text setup.txt</strong> (<em>this</em> document)</li>
<li><strong>+ 5ives post five ways to make the party all about you.txt</strong> (potential list for <a href="http://www.5ives.com/">5ives</a>)</li>
<li><strong>+ work letter larry tate 2005-10-23.txt</strong> </li>
</ul>


<hr>


<p>So that&#8217;s my current system. It&#8217;s actually not as byzantine as it sounds. It really comes down to:</p>

<ul>
<li>fast creation</li>
<li>fast addition</li>
<li>fast archiving</li>
<li><em>invisibility</em> and intuitiveness</li>
</ul>

<p>Your mileage will certainly vary, but I hope this stuff helps if you&#8217;ve been working to tame your own text beast.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I talked about how I&#8217;m using text files, and <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/11/21/qs-redux/">my post a while ago on Quicksilver appending</a>  reminded me of a few little changes I&#8217;ve made over the past year or so that my fellow text geeks might find interesting.</p>

<h3>Reviewing: Why text?</h3>

<p>Like a lot of geeks and aspirational geeks, I do as many things as possible in plain text files. I&#8217;ve endlessly sung the praises of text on 43F, but in a nutshell, they&#8217;re portable, efficient, tiny, and almost endlessly mungible. They&#8217;re the <em>lingua franca</em> of Unix and most of the civilized world.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;ll see, I use text files for any variety of things, although my favorite use is for making and maintaining lists. The <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/11/21/qs-redux/">aforementioned append functionality</a> lets me quickly add items to any file with nothing but muscle memory and a few keystrokes. Best thing ever.</p>

<p>I also <em>write</em> in text files as well as store large amounts of reference information. Text is very easy to swap into HTML (I keep almost everything in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> format), and text is wonderfully searchable, whether using Spotlight, Find &amp; Replace, or just via incremental search from within the editor.</p>

<p>Point being: I use applications like OmniOutliner, iCal, and (formerly) Entourage to organize the relationships between silos in my life; but text files are the living repositories for as much of the actual information as I can manage.</p>

<h3>Getting a system</h3>

<p>Like everything, this text system benefits from a loose organizational framework that lets me quickly create and change files without having to worry too much about what it&#8217;s called, where it goes, and how I&#8217;ll find it again. So here&#8217;s a few high points from my text world.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<h3>One and only one place</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve whittled down to a single folder for all my active text files with just two sub-directories, &#8220;Archives&#8221; and &#8220;Old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old&#8221; is simply where I dragged every text file I was pretty sure was dead or obviated (but you never know), and &#8220;Archives&#8221; is where I put the dearly-departed since making the move to the one folder to rule them all. Archiving is done&#8230;well&#8230;whenever I feel like it or notice that the top txt directory is starting to seem a little wooly.</p>

<p>Everything else sits in one directory. I use a little system of &#8220;meta symbols&#8221; and intuitive naming to keep things organized in the one big folder.</p>

<h3>A smart name</h3>

<p>Nearly all my files are named according to this structure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>Metasymbol SphereOfLife Project UniqueIntuitiveFilename VersionNumber.txt</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Metasymbol</strong> tells me whether the file is a running list, a reference file, or a static document (more on this in a minute)</li>
<li><strong>Sphere of Life</strong> is simply something like &#8220;work&#8221; or &#8220;home&#8221; or &#8220;43 folders&#8221; &#8212; any &#252;ber-silo that represents, say, 20% or more of your time and attention (hint: abbreviations are good here)</li>
<li><strong>Project</strong> is what it sounds like: &#8220;Make-Articles&#8221; or &#8220;Johns-Site&#8221; or whatever (hint: abbreviations are good here too)</li>
<li>The <strong>unique file name</strong> is the first and most intuitive name that pops into my head, sometimes augmented with redundant acronyms, etc. For me it&#8217;s important to be able to find stuff quickly in Quicksilver, so I leave big fat hooks that account for whatever I&#8217;m likely to be looking for in the future</li>
<li><strong>Version number</strong> is a slick little trick of mine. When I start a new version of a document, instead of adding a &#8220;2&#8243; or &#8220;3&#8243; to the most recent copy, I simply duplicate the document, then timestamp the <em>old</em> one &#8212; ala &#8220;<code>+ work haa site design proposal-2005-12-12_08-16-34.txt</code>&#8220;. That way I always know the <em>unversioned</em> copy is the most recent, but I still have backups I can roll back to any time. Neato.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Meta symbols</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve discovered I have three basic kinds of text files, and chose a simple method for marking the <em>type</em> of files they are for quick visual cueing.</p>

<p>This is <em>super helpful</em> for winnowing file names in Quicksilver: I start by typing one of these unusual (non-alpha-numeric) characters, and I can instantly pop to just a list of the <em>types</em> of files I want to see.</p>

<h4>Running lists</h4>

<p>Running lists are the majority of my files. They&#8217;re the kinds of lists that I mentioned in the appending article &#8212; ongoing places to park ideas of any kind over time. They begin with a &#8220;<strong>&gt;</strong>&#8220;. This is, as with all these, purely my own convention, so you should feel free to pick symbols that make sense for you. This yields file names like:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&gt; broken.txt</strong> - items or functionalities in my world that need repair or fixes</li>
<li><strong>&gt; mom birthday gift ideas.txt</strong> - ways to delight the one what brung me</li>
<li><strong>&gt; webdav wish list and questions.txt</strong> - little projects for my newfound favorite technology</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reference</h4>

<p>Reference items are evergreen and reusable content that I update fairly infrequently and refer to as needed.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>^ work resume.txt</strong> </li>
<li><strong>^ 43f site bio.txt</strong> </li>
<li><strong>^ work domains I&#8217;m not using.txt</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>Static files</h4>

<p>These are things like blog posts, articles, and any kind of nonce content that will be used once, and then probably not needed again (making them very quick to archive every month or so).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>+ 43f post new text setup.txt</strong> (<em>this</em> document)</li>
<li><strong>+ 5ives post five ways to make the party all about you.txt</strong> (potential list for <a href="http://www.5ives.com/">5ives</a>)</li>
<li><strong>+ work letter larry tate 2005-10-23.txt</strong> </li>
</ul>


<hr>


<p>So that&#8217;s my current system. It&#8217;s actually not as byzantine as it sounds. It really comes down to:</p>

<ul>
<li>fast creation</li>
<li>fast addition</li>
<li>fast archiving</li>
<li><em>invisibility</em> and intuitiveness</li>
</ul>

<p>Your mileage will certainly vary, but I hope this stuff helps if you&#8217;ve been working to tame your own text beast.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>Compiling a list of the best links of the year was a little more difficult than last year. I put more effort this year into selecting quality links for kottke.org, so there wasn't a lot of chaff to be found in the archives. I also posted a lot more links this year, over half again as many as in 2004. I'm not sure this year's installment is any better than <a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/12/best-links-2004">last year's list</a>, but if you've got a little time to waste at work as 2005 winds down, there's probably something here to keep you occupied.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'>
		
		<p>Are we there yet?</p>

<p>While everyone else tells you that 2005 was the year of disasters and chaos, I was too busy trying to figure out the cultural significance of <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">Million Dollar Homepage</a> and the E!'s <a href="http://www.eonline.com/News/Specials/Jackson/">Michael Jackson trial re-enactments</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, it wasn't a great year, but at least you didn't hear anyone use the phrase "year of the blog" anymore. So just thank your lucky stars the whole friggin world didn't blow up, and prepare yourself for next year when it undoubtedly will.</p>

<p>And with that shot of optimism, I present my idiosyncratic mix of <strong>Predictions for 2006 in Media, Technology, and Pop Culture</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Netflix will be bought by TiVo, which will be bought by Yahoo. Since I obviously should be drawn and quartered for last year's prediction that Apple would buy TiVo, I might as well double-down on my bet.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Absolutely no one will buy Knight Ridder. C'mon, would you?</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> NBC's new Thursday comedy line up will be a big enough success that tv execs will once again try to invoke the phrase "destination tv," while the rest of us have no idea what network or time the shows are even on because our TiVo neglects to tell us.</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> A new Pew study will reveal something about internet use that will be drastically over-cited by people who are reading this blog post.</p>

<p><strong>5)</strong> David Chappelle will do something that makes everyone ask "why the hell did he do that?" It will be "brilliant," but "enigmatic and frustrating."</p>

<p><strong>6)</strong> Showtime will pick up <em>Arrested Development</em>. And then Showtime will announce a deal with iTunes in which the show becomes the first of its kind to have more viewers watching via portable player than on tv.</p>

<p><strong>7)</strong> "Hello Katie, welcome to CBS."</p>

<p><strong>8)</strong> After a guest appearance on <em>Veronica Mars</em>, <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/">Amanda Congdon</a> will sign a deal to host a new show on UPN. That's <em>Viacom-owned</em> UPN, peeps. You know, CBS. So get ready for the Katie and Amanda show in '07.</p>

<p><strong>9)</strong> Book publishers will drop their silly little fiat and announce a triumphant partnership with <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Print</a>.</p>

<p><strong>10)</strong> Nonetheless, Google's stock price will slip 20% by the end of the year.</p>

<p><strong>11)</strong> Someone in Seattle or San Francisco will get beaten to death at a dinner party after saying the words "Web 2.0" for the five-trillionth time before the first course.</p>

<p><strong>12)</strong> 2005: the year of search. 2006: the year of mobile. No, for real this time! The big change will be that carriers open up the deck to external providers. Why? Because Google releases the killer mobile apps that everyone needs. <em>Seriously!</em></p>

<p><strong>13)</strong> <a href="http://www.current.tv/">Current TV</a> will start to show up in Nielsen. The numbers will be good, not great.</p>

<p><strong>14)</strong> The break-up of Viacom will have unforeseen repercussions. Okay, that's vague, but I predict no less than three essays from Marketwatch.com about the failure of the split.</p>

<p><strong>15)</strong> Steve Jobs will announce a DVR. That one's a no-brainer, but the big deal here is that iTunes video downloads will skyrocket. No wait, that's a no-brainer too. Fine, I predict...</p>

<p><strong>16)</strong> iTunes will give in to record labels and adjust pricing such that songs will range from $.50 to $2. Oh hell, another no-brainer.</p>

<p><strong>17)</strong> Sirius will double subscribers but it still won't be enough to pay Howard Stern's salary.</p>

<p><strong>18)</strong> David Letterman will announce his retirement. Or at least I hope so, because right now it's like watching your favorite band from the '80s do a reunion show.</p>

<p><strong>19)</strong> Microsoft's new operating system, Vista, will launch in mid-summer, and will get surprisingly good reviews.</p>

<p><strong>20)</strong> Despite the <em>L.A. Times</em>' dismal failure, several media organizations will release successful wikis -- this time, in areas that actually make sense.</p>

<p><strong>21)</strong> Martha Stewart will quietly become a nobody. Donald Trump, however, will still somehow manage to remain famous.</p>

<p><strong>22)</strong> Mary-Kate and Ashley will return. Where the hell did they go, anyway? Some upcoming indie film director will cast them in a "quirky New York film" with Parker Posey playing their mom. Gen-Xers suddenly realize they're the next Baby Boomers.</p>

<p><strong>23)</strong> One person will finally figure out a cool use for <a href="http://base.google.com/">Google Base</a>, sparking over-use of the word "mashup" by Slashdot nerds.</p>

<p><strong>24)</strong> At the end of the year, the <em>New York Times</em> will drop <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/products/timesselect/overview.html">Times Select</a>. Soon after, CNN.com will make <a href="http://www.cnn.com/pipeline/">Pipeline</a> free.</p>

<p><strong>25)</strong> Despite some inspired ideas, Craig Newmark's new journalism project won't be a gigantic success, but it will inspire others sites that quickly take off.</p>

<p><strong>26)</strong> News Corp's purchase of MySpace will yield a decent record label that has a surprise hit.</p>

<p><strong>27)</strong> FBC -- Fox Business Channel -- will launch. Pundits describe it as "more fun" than CNBC.</p>

<p><strong>28)</strong> Ten major cities will release city-wide WiFi.</p>

<p><strong>29)</strong> Fergie from Black-Eyed Peas will announce a solo album. It will be <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>'s worst album of the year for 2006.</p>

<p><strong>30)</strong> The <em>New York Times</em> Sunday Styles section will write a trend piece about the trend of trend pieces. It will then implode.</p>

<p><strong>31)</strong> Chuck Klosterman will announce he's writing new columns for <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>Wired</em>, and <em>Modern Midwestern Living</em>.</p>

<p><strong>32)</strong> Fimoculous.com makes a triumphant return as an "almost decent" blog.</p>

<p><strong>33)</strong> Anderson Cooper will claim he's the father of Katie Holmes' baby. A wicked paternity suit -- in which everyone refuses to take DNA tests -- ensues.</p>

<p>Note: I have zero insider knowledge on any of these predictions. And except for the last one, I actually believe them all, if only metaphorically in some cases.</p>

<p>As he explains: "For those with better things to do than keep up with MMO acronym variants: the terms MMOEG (MMO Erotic Games) and MMOVSG (MMO Virtual Sex Games) are used pretty much interchangeably for a genre of multi-player online game that gives primacy to some aspect of sex or sexuality", and he then lists a number of (NSFW!) links that most notably include <a href="http://www.spendthenight.com/">Spend The Night</a>, the <a href="http://www.igda.org/sex/archives/2005/10/5_questions_gle.html">higher-profile erotic MMO</a> to be launched this year by LA-based <a href="http://www.republikgames.com/">Republik Games</a>.</p>

<p>Interesting, Reynolds then asks: "Commercially the question that I think hangs over these games (like a dildo of Damocles one might say) is: What&#8217;s the point?", suggesting that "...the problem that these MMOs face is that if cyber-sex interests you there is no shortage of [non-MMO] ways to explore it."

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>
  Every year at this time, everyone and anyone who has a vested interest in selling stocks comes out and talks about
  how great a year its going to be in the stockmarket.&#160; Of course its all nonsense and bullshit. NO ONE knows what
  the market is going to do.
</p>


<p>
  &#160;
</p>


<p>Not timers. Not technical charts. Not economists, Not brokerage Heads of Research, Not stock pickers. No one. If you
watch CNBC, over the last few months they have taken to putting &#8220;experts&#8221; who disagree up against each other on stocks
and topics. Instead of having carte blance to come across as an expert, they have to offer some support and take some
criticism. Its a blast to watch because there rarely is a winner.&#160; Its so rare that they get questioned that they
have lost the ability to support their own positions. So much for experts.</p>


<p>If its hard to find an expert who can support their investmen choices, what about mutual funds ?</p>


<p>According to an ad for one family of mutual funds, there are 17,000 mutual funds on the market for purchase.&#160;
How amazing is that ? How in the world can there be 17,000 fund managers that are worth a damn ? There cant be. How
many are good ? How many suck ? How many of the funds will close every year taking your money with them ? Are you
completely confident in the fund that is taking money from your paycheck every 2 weeks ?</p>


<p>Then of course there are the brokerages. I swear that there are few things that turn my stomach on TV more than
watching commercials for brokerages. The guy who gives the toast at the wedding, Paul McCartney, the guy from Law &amp;
Order, all trying to con people into thinking that any of their stockbrokers can take you to a financial promised
land.</p>


<p>&#160;Well guess what, they cant. Yes there are good stockbrokers that are worth the commissions you pay them, but
guess what ? Most of the good ones work with people who already have money, not ones with very little hoping to build a
nest egg.</p>


<p>One fun little thing I like to do is to look at &#8220;The Favorites&#8221;. The list of the stocks held by he largest number of
accounts at Merrill Lynch.&#160;These are the stocks that the largest&#160;brokerage, with the largest number of
consumer clients is being enticed , convinced or directed to invest in. These are the stocks that Merrill Lynch
stockbrokers have had the most success selling. They are their favorite products.</p>


<p>Its interesting&#160; how well the names are performing, but also&#160; how the names have changed , or in some
cases, not changed over the years. A look at the last list of 2005 doesnt inspire overwhelming confidence in the
ability of Merrill to pick stocks.&#160;&#160; 7&#160;winners. 13 losers. Biggest winner was Exxon at 9.7pct.&#160; On
the losing side, there were 7 stocks that lost 10 pct or more and 3 that lost 20pct or more.&#160; And these are the
stocks that many would&#160;classify as todays &#8220;widows and orphans&#8221; stocks.</p>


<p>Of coure they are completely different from the widows and orphans stocks of yesteryear. GM, Ford, Utilities&#8230;.Just
put them away and dont think about them. Now that was good advice wasnt it. And
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/2002outlook/2001-most-widely-held.htm">here is the list from Jan of
2002</a>. You havent done so well if you took Merrills advice then, or now. To be fair , Merrill is not better or worse
than any other full service brokerage. They just happen to publish their list of widely held stocks.</p>


<p>So what to do if you want to invest your money ? What to do if you want to end this year with more than you started
with ?</p>


<p>Simple, avoid risk.</p>


<p>Risk is what Wall Street lies about every day. Risk is what they try to sweep under the covers knowing that we all
are addicted to the dream of financial freedom. Risk is the poison that is masked by the commercials.&#160;</p>


<p>When you see a commercial for a brokerage, they are telling you in a very subtle way that they remove risk. Invest
with them and the risks regarding investing that you have heard about will be reduced or eliminated because they are so
smart.&#160; All of which they say before&#160;they rush through all the disclaimers that confirm that everything they
just said is nonsense, that they cant really avoid risk.</p>


<p>You can however make the personal decision to avoid risk. Avoiding risk allows you to sleep at night. Avoiding risk
allows you to have more at the end of the year than when you started.</p>


<p>Lots of people spent a lot of money on commissions this year. If you put your money in the bank, in a CD or in
treasuries, you not only slept better than them, there is a very, very good chance you kicked their ass in total
return. Your interest compounded, they probably paid interest on their investments.</p>


<p>I get emails every day asking me where people should invest. I tell them all the same thing, and I will say it here.
Put your money in&#160;interest earning&#160;investments.</p>


<p>&#160;For every stock you buy, there is someone selling you that stock. What is it that you know that they dont ?
What is it that they know, that you dont ? Who has the edge ? If its not you. Chances are you are going to lose money
on the deal.</p>


<p>If you want more info on how i feel about the stock market,
<a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/2252572946170125/">here is another blog entry on the topic</a>.</p>


<p>So here is my investment advice for anyone who doesn&#8217;t have enough saved to walk away from their job and
retire&#8230;</p>


<p>1. If interest rates stay where they are or go higher, look at 5 year or shorter maturity vehicles. It doesnt matter
if its a bank CD, a money market fund, a tax free fund, treasuries or combinations there of. Bottom line is this, 4plus
percent taxed, or up to 6 plus percent tax free equivalent (depending on your tax bracket), is not a bad way to go. If
rates go down, do the same thing, evenif you earn a lower rate. At the end of the year, you are guaranteed to have more
than you started with.</p>


<p>2. Evaluate your lifestyle. People forget that sometimes the best investment they can make is in wisely buying
things they know they will use. If you track what you use and consume, whether its gas vs bus fare, buying bulk
quantities or other discretionary spending, you can save more and earn a far greater return than you could in the stock
market. If you can save 10pct per month on a hundred dollar per month budget, thats 120 bucks you can put in the bank.
Thats the equivalent of earning 12 pct on a 1k dollar investment. If you can cut 100 bucks per month off 1k dollar
monthly budget, thats like earning 12 pct on 10k dollars. Thats pretty darn good.&#160; Spend smart, put your savings
in risk averse, interest earning offerings.</p>


<p>3. Invest in yourself. Do the things that can get you closer to your goals and dreams. It wont come from a brokerage
commercial. It will come from preparing yourself ,&#160; working hard and standing apart from your competition. You Inc
is the best stock you can ever buy&#8230;if you are willing to do the work.</p>

  <p>What I find&#8230;most people in southern California don&#8217;t <em>suffer</em> enough, so [the Buddha] also taught how to be <em>happy</em>&#8230;What I find, if I&#8217;m speaking to people under 40, I talk about how to be happy, and if I speak to people over 40, I talk about how not to suffer.

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><h3>Review</h3>

<p>Happy new year everyone! Hope you had a rockin&#8217; holiday season.</p>

<p>This is the 4th article in my Small Biz 101 series here on SvN. The first three were: <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/small_biz_101_how_to_get_started.php">How to Get Started</a>, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/small_biz_101_cash_flow.php">Cash Flow Basics</a> and <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/small_biz_101_no_one_starts_with_a_masterpiece.php">No One Starts with a Masterpiece</a>. </p>

<p>In case we haven&#8217;t met before, my name is Ryan Carson and I&#8217;m the founder of <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com">Carson Systems</a>, where we work hard to bring you <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com">Carson Workshops</a>, <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">DropSend</a>, <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit">The Future of Web Apps</a> and <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com">Vitamin</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of this series is to share some of the lessons I&#8217;ve learned from starting my own small business. With that in mind, I&#8217;m going to tackle the tricky subject of how to bring in the dough.</p>

<h3>How to bring in  customers </h3>

<p>So you&#8217;ve quit your 9-to-5 and you&#8217;re ready to make  millions. How do you get started? </p>
<p>Welcome to the world of sales. Whether you&#8217;re in the service industry  or the product business, you need to sell, sell and sell some more. </p>

<p>You may be thinking &quot;Wait a minute. I started my own company because I&#8217;m passionate about XYZ, not to be a salesman.&quot; This couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth. As soon as you start your own company, sales is your raison d&#8217;&#234;tre. Don&#8217;t stress though, it&#8217;s not as bad as you think. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had the privilege of being in both the service industry (working as a web developer) and the product industry (selling web applications), so here some tips and tricks I&#8217;ve picked up along the way:</p>

<h3>8 ways to increase sales </h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Network like a crazy person.</strong> People do business with people they know and trust. It&#8217;s that simple. However, when you&#8217;re out meeting new people, don&#8217;t just think about ways they can help you, think about how you can help them too. </li>
    <li><strong>Create a niche.</strong> Pick a specific area to excel in and tackle that. This will make it much easier to focus your efforts and beat the competition.</li>
    <li><strong>Get your pricing right.</strong> Often when you start out, you won&#8217;t get your prices quite right. We recently encountered this with Carson Workshops. We decided to drop the prices from $695 to $495 on our US workshops (<a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/dev/fuchs/26JAN2006.html">Getting Started with Ajax</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/dev/henderson/16FEB2006.html">How We Built Flickr</a>). It was a tough call, but in the end we felt it gave the best value to customers, while still retaining reasonable profits.</li>
    <li><strong>What&#8217;s In It For Them?</strong> As I mentioned in my <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/small_biz_101_how_to_get_started.php">first article</a>, these are some of the most powerful words you will ever learn. Why would someone purchase your product or service? What will they gain? Be harshly honest.</li>
    <li><strong>Don&#8217;t be an ass.</strong> This may sound obvious, but people like doing business with nice people. If you&#8217;re friendly and kind, it&#8217;s way more likely people will become repeat customers (not to mention the fact it&#8217;s just a better way to live). </li>
    <li> <strong>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. </strong>Put yourself in your customer&#8217;s shoes. Treat your customers like you would want to be treated.</li>
    <li><strong>Be thrifty with your marketing.</strong> In the early days of Carson Systems, I threw away tons of money on things like direct mail, phone calls, ad campaigns, etc. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just not worth it for small businesses. Things like blogs, newsletters and networking, are virtually free, whilst being very effective.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a CRM tool. </strong>A great way to keep in touch with your customers and encourage repeat business is to use a customer relationship manager (CRM) tool. If you want to give someone a call and can&#8217;t remember what you spoke about last time, a CRM tool is invaluable. I&#8217;ve heard the 37signals crew <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/sunrise_37signals_crm_tool_for_small_business_is_coming_soon.php">have something up their sleeve</a> in this area, so keep an eye out. </li>
</ol>

<p>So hopefully you&#8217;ll find the above tips useful for getting new customers, but how can you  deal with the inevitable rejections that will  come your way? Here are a couple useful tips: </p>

<h3>5 ways to avoid discouragement</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Be realistic.</strong> There&#8217;s nothing worse than making crazy optimistic goals and then crashing back down to reality. Start off with realistic, achievable sales goals. When you hit them, congratulate yourself and increase them. </li>
    <li><strong>Make daily goals.</strong> If you know you need to get five new customers a month, then work backward from that and figure out how many contacts/phone calls you need to make to achieve those five sales. Then divide this by the number of working days in the month. If you have an achievable daily goal, you&#8217;ll feel great when you check it off your list. </li>
    <li><strong>Find someone to encourage you.</strong> I spent the first year of Carson Systems as the sole employee and it was insanely discouraging at times. If it wasn&#8217;t for my wonderful wife and faithful cat (who I found myself talking to), I would&#8217;ve given up. Find someone who you can have a beer with on a weekly basis, and share your victories and defeats with them.</li>
    <li><strong>Get the hard stuff over with first.</strong> If you know you <em>hate</em> a certain task, get it over with first. After it&#8217;s over, you&#8217;ll feel exhilarated the rest of the day. If you put it off till the end of the day, you&#8217;ll spend the whole day dreading it. </li>
    <li> <strong>Don&#8217;t take rejection personally.</strong> A large percentage of potential customers will say no (and some will even be nasty about it). Just remind yourself that it&#8217;s totally normal and they&#8217;re not rejecting you personally. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I hope I&#8217;ve given you a couple ideas on how to increase sales and steer clear of the inevitable discouragement that will come your way. If you put these ideas to work, you&#8217;ll have a good head start on the competition. </p>

<p>In the next article, I&#8217;ll dish out some juicy tips for self promotion and marketing. Meanwhile, if you&#8217;ve got any great tips for getting new customers, please comment below.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'>
        <p>Lots of people in both the music/media and technology businesses are obsessed with beating Apple's work on the iPod and iTunes. With the <span>CES </span>show being this week, that obsession will reach its annual peak, so I figured I'd take the time to post a list I'd made some time ago. Herewith, a list of the key dos and don'ts for beating Apple's iPod and iTunes, in no particular order.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Do: Be Rock and Roll.</strong> Have an attitude, be All About The Music, and express yourself. Now, that doesn't mean you have to have faux-edgy marketing copy for your service or device, but just that you should make decisions for your products based on what a music fan would want.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li><strong>Don't: Try to teach kids about <span>DRM.</span></strong> Now, if and when iTunes eventually loses in the market, it will be because of <span>DRM.</span> And you can get significant advantages by just embracing unprotected <span>MP3</span>s, since that's what most people want and they work with everything. But the thing is, <span>DRM </span>is boring. <strong>Teaching consumers about <span>DRM </span>is like giving your cat a bath:</strong> You're only going to piss her off, and she'd do a better job of it on her own anyway. Explain your lack of <span>DRM </span>in terms of user benefits instead of technology, and you'll avoid <a href="http://www.majordojo.com/2006/01/increasingly_di.php">disgruntled customer testimonials</a>.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li><strong>Do: Make something that breaks in, instead of breaking down.</strong> The iPod's greatest flaw is that it's designed to inspire reverence and requires being coddled. Remember being rock and roll? Rock is about leather and denim, which wear with time and get <em>more</em> personality as they're used. Kind of like a good guitar. And being able to drop an <span>MP3 </span>player in a crowded high school cafeteria without everyone laughing that your expensive device is destroyed is a killer app.</li>
</ul>


        
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't: Forget about the rest of the world.</strong> The iTunes store neglected most countries in the world for most of its history, and is only just starting to remedy the problem years later. And the store's library offers an abysmal selection of international songs. Even here in the <span>U.S., </span>one quarter of Americans are either immigrants or have an immigrant family member, which connects them to the international community. Their music and videos are pretty much invisible in Apple's world -- sounds like an opportunity to me.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li><strong>Do: Let people make their own music.</strong> Apple lets people make music with GarageBand, and lets people buy music with iTunes, but doesn't let people sell or distribute their own songs. That means companies who make music-making tools ranging from Acid to ProTools don't have an easy venue to get their music in front of an audience. And most of them don't want to make money, they just want people to hear their songs. "I can get my boyfriend's band's music" is a great way to combat an iTunes exclusive track.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li><strong>Don't: Try to fit in.</strong> Everyone's gone from making super-ugly <span>MP3 </span>players to coming as close to cloning the iPod as possible without getting sued. What about headphones with an <span>LED </span>built in, if you're insistent on calling attention to yourself? What about wireless headphones, to neutralize the cool factor of the white cord in the iPod ads? And why aren't you selling "the music player for the rest of us"? Now that the iPod is downright ubiquitous, you can play up the subversive angle of <em>not</em> wearing the white earphones: Trying not to wear the same thing as everyone else is exactly what rock and roll is about. Tell kids they deserve a music player as unique as they are, and remind everyone that white is the color of sheep.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li><strong>Do: Make friends with Radio and <span>TV.</span></strong> No, no, not in the old-fashioned Clear Channel way. For this audience, <span>XM,</span> Sirius, Netflix and Tivo define radio and television, and that content should be natively made part of their experience. Not just that I can copy a show from my Tivo to my device, but that my XM account is integrated and automatically syncing up to my player. A discount on the songs that I've listened to on Sirius radio. In short, a <em>real</em> connection to the other media I'm consuming.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li><strong> Don't: Forget about the geeks.</strong> Hackers will make the features that aren't economical for you to create, that are too far-out for you to think of, and that are so personal and unique that they really draw people into forming a personal connection with your product or service. Right now, the iPod tries desperately to block any creative hacking that people do with the device. Sure, there's no mass market for a Beowulf cluster powered by <span>MP3 </span>players, but there may be a lucrative long tail of buyers who want little applets or hardware hacks for the hard drives they're carrying around everywhere.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li><strong>Do: Invest in the experience.</strong> The thing Apple has shown with the iPod's success is that people are willing to spend a premium for a good experience, even at the expense of features, freedom, or flexibility. If you can offer a distinctive experience that exceeds what Apple can do in any of these regards, there's the potential for a big win. Creative wasted millions on a misbegotten campaign to have their Zen players take on the iPod, but for the $300 million dollars they blew on billboards or bus stop ads, they could have paid Kanye or Coldplay to play a gig in the living room of some music fan. People want a connection to the music and musicians they care about, and they want to take part in experiences that are beyond the reach of their connections or wallets. Give them the chance to really meet (or <em>be</em>) a rock star, and you'll have something better than just another <span>MP3 </span>player.</li>
</ul>
