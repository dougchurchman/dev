<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>Guy Kawasaki follows up his <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/the_top_ten_lie.html">Top Ten Lies of Venture Capitalists</a> with <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/the_top_ten_lie_1.html">Top Ten Lies of Entrepreneurs</a>.</p>

<p>I obviously don&#8217;t get pitched for investment by other entrepreneurs, so I don&#8217;t know what lies are being told, but I&#8217;ll tack on some of my own &#8220;at face value&#8221; comments to the top ten (actually 11):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&#8220;Our projections are conservative.&#8221; Like Guy says, an entrepreneur has no idea what her sales will be. Projections, like fortune telling, are a waste of time.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Gartner says our market will be $50 billion in 2010.&#8221; 1. Who cares what Gartner says &#8212; Gartner isn&#8217;t giving you any of that $50 billion. 2. If you have a slide like this in your deck, 1: get rid of it, and 2: get rid of your deck. Talk from passion, not from slides.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Boeing is going to sign our purchase order next week.&#8221; I love this one. My advice: Never bet your business on one customer. Ever. Never give preferential treatment either. Every customer outta be the same to you or you&#8217;re going to start favoring the minority instead of the majority.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Key employees are set to join us as soon as we get funded.&#8221; If you&#8217;re small (and you probably are if you&#8217;re pitching VCs), <strong>everyone</strong> should be a key employee. To say your key employees aren&#8217;t on board yet is to denigrate everyone you already have and that&#8217;s no way to build a passionate team. Further more, it&#8217;s an empty promise. You can&#8217;t control other offers other people may also have while waiting for your precious funding to come though.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;No one is doing what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221; It&#8217;s exceedingly rare that you&#8217;re 1. the only person whose thought of that, and 2. the only person doing something about it. It&#8217;s possible you are, but highly unlikely. Don&#8217;t bank on it. Like Guy says, &#8220;As a rule of thumb, if you have a good idea, five companies are going the same thing. If you have a great idea, fifteen companies are doing the same thing.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;No one can do what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221; Amen. Face it: technology is a commodity these days. If you can do it, someone else can do it. And it&#8217;s likely they can do it better. What really makes the difference is design, copywriting, execution, clarity, passion, and the overall customer experience. The stuff you can&#8217;t specifically define or bulletpoint are the things that matter.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Hurry because several other venture capital firms are interested.&#8221; If you cry wolf you better be ready to rescue yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Oracle is too big/dumb/slow to be a threat.&#8221; Fear and fire are good things when it comes to being an entrepreneur. If you don&#8217;t think you can be beat by the big guys you better think again. Yes, they&#8217;re slower, but they may be slow enough to watch what you&#8217;re doing, learn from your mistakes, and then clobber you down the road. I still think small has major advantages in the world of the web app, but you better be humble if you want to play this game.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;We have a proven management team.&#226;&#128;&#157; Guy says this one best: &#8220;If the entrepreneur were that proven, that he (a) probably wouldn&#8217;t have to ask for money; (b) wouldn&#8217;t be claiming that he&#8217;s proven. (Do you think Wayne Gretzky went around saying, &#8220;I am a good hockey player&#8221;?)&#8221; Point here is that most of the people who have to tell others about their greatness usually aren&#8217;t so great (except for Muhammad Ali, of course). The way to demonstrate greatness is to prove it today, not to point to the past.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Patents make our product defensible.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know anything about this so I&#8217;ll be quiet.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;All we have to do is get 1% of the market.&#8221; If your goal is to get just 1% of the market then you don&#8217;t have the fire necessary to get 2%. There&#8217;s nothing closer to nothing than 1.</p></li>

        <p><img alt="cats.jpg" src="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/cats.jpg" hspace="5" align="left"> A few days ago, we featured <a href="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2005/12/welcome_to_the_world_of_sand.php">the excellent 'World Of Sand' Java toy</a>, and now, TIGSource has <a href="http://www.tigsource.com/forums/viewtopic.php?id=403">drawn our attention to the fact</a> that creator 'd_of_i' has several other fully playable browser games on his site, with the highlight being the marvellous <a href="http://ishi.blog2.fc2.com/blog-entry-151.html">'Cats Sledding'</a>.</p>

<p>What's 'Cats Sledding'? It features, uhh, cats sledding! As explained by TIGSource: "The game controls like a konami motocross game or some other games you might have played recently: use the z and x keys to lean your cat and flip in midair. like in nintendo's <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/uniracers">uniracers/unirally</a>, successful tricks are rewarded with speed boosts."</p>

<p>Additionally noted by the author of the blog post? "you might also want to check out <a href="http://ishi.blog2.fc2.com/blog-entry-73.html">this game</a> and <a href="http://ishi.blog2.fc2.com/blog-entry-91.html">its breakout-like sequel</a> by the same author, which involve swinging rice balls around with your mouse. you cannot go wrong."</p>

        <p><img alt="probe.jpg" src="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/probe.jpg" hspace="5" align="left"> Scandinavian magazine firm MagWerk has launched <a href="http://www.magwerk.com">three intricately-designed online magazines</a>, laid out like normal mags, but with a host of Flash animated adverts, editorial sections, and other clever gubbins. Interestingly, one of these is  <a href="http://www.magwerk.com/mag.php?magazine=probe&amp;language=en">an English language version</a> of the 'game culture' magazine Probe, also available in Norwegian and Swedish.</p>

<p>Some of the neat ideas on the site, which is sponsored by Mini and Sony Ericsson, include 'pages' that actually link to HTML weblogs, so are regularly updated, and other fun shenanigans, including an actual game of (unlicensed?) <a href="http://www.klov.com/A/Asteroids.html">Asteroids</a> on two pages.</p>

<p>In addition, on at least one of <a href="http://www.magwerk.com/mag.php?magazine=probe&amp;language=en">Probe</a>'s spreads, the editor's animated pictures are attacking each other - and the editorial, with Xbox 360 features and lots of game reviews,  is reasonably readable too. In conclusion - well worth perusing. [Via <a href="http://www.the-inbetween.com">The-Inbetween</a>.]</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>Paul Hammant says <a href="http://paulhammant.com/blog/ruby-versus-javascript-for-web3.0.html">"Bring on text/rhtml on the client side"</a> for Web 3.0:</p>
	<blockquote><p>
If the client and server technology were pure Java (say Swing), then a refactoring either using the IDEs functions or good old cut and paste would allow you to quickly move the applicable methods from one place to another.</p>
	<p>It got me thinking that for Web2.0 your cut/paste solution is not going work.  For the audience in question, Ruby on Rails is the weapon of choice on the server side, but the client remains HTML/JavaScript.   Wouldn't they prefer a future and ubiquitous web-browser environment that allows Ruby as the script language interspersed amongst HTML lines?
</p></blockquote>
	<p>As Paul mentions, Rails solves the problem of redundancy by generating Javascript (server-side Javascript is another option.) He discusses the idea of a Ruby plugin, though it's not clear how it would be any more successful than ye olde Java plugins. How much of a problem is it to use different languages for client and server? After all, this used to happen a lot (and still happens) in desktop systems, where there's no compulsion to do so.</p>
	<p>Of course, it's not just the benefits of a single language, but also a potentially *better* language. An interesting quote from Charles Lowell:</p>
	<blockquote><p>
I, for one, would love to see the DOM scriptable from Ruby. As languages go, javascript and ruby are quite close. I'd even venture so far as to say that javascript is much closer to ruby in spirit than it is to its own namesake.</p>
	<p>That said, there are two reasons I would prefer DOM scripting in ruby. The first, and most important is the rich api that comes bundled with it. Even if all I could take with me were Array, Set and Hash, it would be well worth it given the uber-sparse set of builtin javascript objects.</p>
	<p>The second is stylistic. A Turing-transexual, javascript is ruby trapped in java's body...

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p><a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/install.png"><img src="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1843&amp;application=firefox"></a></p>
	<p>FireBug is a new tool for Firefox that aids with debugging Javascript, DHTML, and Ajax. It is like a combination of the Javascript Console, DOM Inspector, and a command line Javascript interpreter.</p>
	<h3>Features</h3>
	<p><b>Log DOM Elements With Your Mouse</b></p>
	<p>Using the &#8220;Pick Element&#8221; tool, you can click DOM Elements in the page to print them to the console. Once they are in the console you can inspect them using a simple strip of tabs.</p>
	<p><b>Log Objects From The Command Line</b></p>
	<p>There is a command line at the bottom of the console which allows you type in arbitrary Javascript expressions. The result of the expressions is printed to the console, where you an the inspect it further using the tabs.</p>
	<p><b>Log Objects From Your Web Page Scripts</b></p>
	<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wished you could tap your toes together and turn <code>alert</code> into <code>printf</code> or <code>System.out.writeln</code>, FireBug is your fairy godmother. It is trivial to log text or objects to the FireBug console from Javascript inside any web page. Go here to find out how.</p>
	<p><b>XMLHttpRequest Spy</b></p>
	<p>Each XMLHttpRequest can be automatically logged to the console, where you can inspect its response as text or xml. Not only is this extremely useful for debugging your own Ajax code, but it&#8217;s also quite fun to analyze how other web pages use Ajax!</p>
	<p><b>Contextual Error Display</b></p>
	<p>Unlike the the Firefox Javascript Console, FireBug&#8217;s console will only show you errors for the page that you are looking at. As you browse from page to page or switch between browser tabs, the console will follow and only show information that is relevant to that page.</p>
	<p><b>Error Status Bar Indicator</b></p>
	<p>Whenever a Javascript, CSS, or XML error occur, a little red indicator will appear in the Firefox status bar. Clicking the indicator will bring up the console with more detail about the errors.</p>
	<p><b>Error Filtering</b></p>
	<p>FireBug allows you to filter what kind of errors you want to appear in the console. This is handy for hiding all those annoying CSS errors, or errors stemming from code inside Firefox itself.</p>

<div><p>I spent more time than I should have playing <a href="http://randomchaos.com/games/fastr/">Fastr</a> this morning, a game where you are shown a group of pictures from Flickr and have to guess the tag before other people do. It's hella fun!! OK. Don't everyone hit this all at once and beat up the server.

<p>I also want to bring you attention to the fact that the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/flickrhks/">Flickr Hacks</a> book from O'Reilly has been released in what O'Reilly is calling the "Long Snout", which is at the other end of the Long Tail: a "Rough Cut" version, which you can get an early copy of digitally, before it goes to press. I wrote a Forward for it, telling a little of the backstory behind the creation of Flickr, and it's a great little book, like everything in their Hacks series.

<p>OK, so I wanted to sit down and workout a grand plan for my new garden, so I figure a pencil and some graph paper is the way forward.</p>

<p>Just finding some simple 2mm graph paper with 1cm semi bold and 2 cm bold turned out to be a near impossible task. Then I discovered the Graph Paper PDF Generator at incompetech.com .<br>
 <br>
It does plain paper, lined paper, multi width, hexagonal, even semi-bisected trapezoid! All completely customizable. And it's free!</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>OK, since the prev post was a bit sourpussy, let me try to be more constructive. So just what kind of meme <em>would</em> I like to see spread? How about this: <strong>If you could give the commencement address at a graduation ceremony, what would you say?</strong></p>

<p>See, I&#8217;ve always been a sucker for commencement speeches. You get something special from that ripe moment when someone gets to impart what they feel is crucial wisdom to less experienced folks at a criticial juncture in their lives (ones delivered by <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/1422863/posts">Steve Jobs</a>, <a href="http://www.february-7.com/features/conan.htm">Conan O&#8217;Brien</a>, and <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/hindsights.html">Guy Kawasaki</a> come to mind &#8212; Yahoo has a <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Education/Graduation/Speeches/">collection of commencement speeches</a>). It&#8217;s the sort of &#8220;what really matters&#8221; stuff that, unfortunately, is usually glazed over in our day to day lives. </p>

<p>So, Mr./Ms. Commencement Speaker, what would you say? Um, tag or something.</p>

<p>And somewhat related, here&#8217;s a little love for <a title="How to Do What You Love" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">How to Do What You Love</a>. Paul Graham is a damn good writer. Some excerpts:</p>

<blockquote>Prestige is just fossilized inspiration.  If you do anything well
enough, you&#8217;ll make it prestigious.  Plenty of things we now
consider prestigious were anything but at first.  Jazz comes to
mind &#8212; though almost any established art form would do.   So just
do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest? One is to try to do a good job at whatever you&#8217;re doing, even if you don&#8217;t like it. Then at least you&#8217;ll know you&#8217;re not using dissatisfaction as an excuse for being lazy. Perhaps more importantly, you&#8217;ll get into the habit of doing things well.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&#8220;Always produce&#8221; is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you&#8217;re supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. &#8220;Always produce&#8221; will discover your life&#8217;s work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Don&#8217;t decide too soon. Kids who know early what they want to do seem impressive, as if they got the answer to some math question before the other kids. They have an answer, certainly, but odds are it&#8217;s wrong.</blockquote>

<p>Alright meme-hungry bloggers, I challenge you to fill my newsreader with content like that instead of four places you&#8217;ve been on vacation.</p>

        <p><img alt="thes.jpg" src="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/thes.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" style="border:thin black solid"> The nice folks over at indie site <a href="http://www.gametunnel.com">GameTunnel</a> have added <a href="http://www.gametunnel.com/articles.php?id=427">their PC indie game review round-up for December</a>, including mini-reviews of a host of games by GT's Russ Carroll, <a href="http://www.sykhronics.com/">Sykhronics</a>' Mike Kasprzak, <a href="http://rtsoft.com/">Robinson Technologies</a>' Seth Robinson, and <a href="http://hamumu.com/">Hamumu</a>'s Mike Hommel.</p>

<p>One of the most notable games this month is 2D bike stunt title <a href="http://www.download.com/Motorama/3003-7563_4-10473985.html">Motorama</a>, of which Seth Robinson comments: "While we can find oodles of brick breaking games every month there aren't a whole lot of "2d side-view bike physics" games being served up, so it was a treat to play Motorama. It's good. It's punishing."</p>

<p>In fact, Motorama ties for game of the month (at a relatively slow time of year!) with isometric shooter <a href="http://www.sigma-team.net/runcms/modules/mydownloads/">Theseus: Return Of The Hero</a>, regarding which Russ Carroll suggests: "Trying to follow in the footsteps of <a href="http://www.gametunnel.com/gamespace.php?id=16&amp;tab=3">Alien Shooter</a>, which in my mind is one of the best games of all time, is no easy task. Theseus plays a lot like a mod of the original game...a very good mod with original weapons and music in addition to expanding the game play." Mm, weekend indie goodness.</p>

<p>We won't spoil the overall winner (go check it out yourself!), but some of the <a href="http://features.moddb.com/218/?fpage=8">Editor's Choice picks</a> are plenty of fun - overall choice goes to student mod (and also IGF Mod Competition finalist) <a href="http://www.eclipsegame.com/">Eclipse</a>, of which it's mentioned: "A group of talented Guildhall students... came together to build the best game they could in five months... This third person mod utilizes an interesting form of combat in which you use telekinesis to lift objects and throw them at your foes. While it may not be a long game, it comes with gorgeous visuals, excellent level desgin and even an original soundtrack."</p>

<p>Also picked as Editor's Choice for an unreleased mod is Max Payne 2 mod <a href="http://mods.moddb.com/5024/">Hall Of Mirrors</a>, of which it's raved: "Have you seen <a href="http://files.moddb.com/273/Download-Hall-of-Mirrors-Trailer/">this trailer</a>? In the immortal words of Starsky and Hutch - DO IT! Slowmo, Matrix-like scenes with tons of bad guys, big moves (flips and stuff)... I damn near wet my pants in anticipation for this mod. Hall of Mirrors is a Total conversion of Max Payne 2 that allows you to live out the journey of Cleric John Preston." So there. [Via <a href="http://www.evilavatar.com">EA</a>.]</p>

<p>Here are the latest pages from my Alchemy Notebook in my Moleskine Pocket Sketchbook.&#160; I have been reading Simon Sigh&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385495323/ninthwavedesigns"><em>The Code Book</em></a>, and have been putting some of the enciphering techniques he details into use.&#160; These two pages are a cipher table I devised for the Alchemy Alphabet I am using, to enable me to further encipher the text.&#160; Why encipher an already unreadable text, you ask?&#160; Because I am a nerd that way.&#160; I have enjoyed codes and ciphers from a young age, and have been having a blast learning the different techniques employed throughout&#160; history to protect messages.&#160; The Alchemists used symbol and obtuse language to protect their knowledge from those they considered uninitiated, so cipher texts fit right in.</p>

<p>I designed each table with its own sliding guide; made from the same Classic Moleskine Sketchbook paper harvested from a sketchbook I have desecrated by removing the pages from it.&#160; The grid on the sliders is blank; I will fill this in after taking the picture so that I don&#39;t divulge the basis for the encryption.&#160; Otherwise, where&#39;s the challenge in that?&#160; You can bet I will write something more interesting than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AYJUW/ninthwavedesigns">&quot;Drink More Ovaltine&quot;</a>.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>Google has <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/02/your-labels-your-way.html">added a nice new feature to their Google Reader</a>. </p>
	<p>The feature is a nice UI widget to pick labels for your feeds. </p>
	<p>As a Mac user, the first piece of software that I would take with me to a desert island would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_%28software%29">Quicksilver</a>. It is beautiful, and it means that you no longer care where you put things... it finds them for you to perform any action that makes sense.</p>
	<p>This is similar to not needing folders in GMail, but just using search to find everything.</p>
	<p>So, it isn't a huge surprise that Quicksilver is well liked at Google, and this new lab selector mimics in in some ways.</p>
	<p><b>Other features</b></p>
	<ul>
	<li>You can hover over item titles in left side list to view them in a tooltip - useful when longer titles are cropped.</li>
	<li>The "keep unread" checkbox works once again in Internet Explorer.</li>
	<li>Don't reset the window scroll position for some keyboard shortcuts (like scan down/up).</li>
	<li>Improved sorting and filtering in the subscriptions drawer.</li>
	<li>Better error messages for empty and not found feeds.</li>
	</ul>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><ol>
<li>Turn off auto-checking, or set it to &#8220;Every hour&#8221; 
<ul><li>yes, it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/02/15/five-fast-email-productivity-tips/">a classic</a>, thanks</li>
<li>In Mail.app, go to &#8220;<code>Mail &gt; Preferences... &gt; General</code>&#8220;</li></ul></li>
<li>Turn off the &#8220;New Mail&#8221; sound
<ul><li>Same place as above</li>
<li>And, while you&#8217;re there, also unclick &#8220;Play sounds for other mail actions&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s not a goddamned pinball machine </li></ul></li>
<li>Turn on Dock Hiding
<ul><li>&#8220;<code>[Apple] &gt; System Preferences &gt; Dock</code>&#8221; and click &#8220;Automatically show and hide the Dock&#8221;</li></ul></li>
<li>Hide Mail.app
<ul><li>In Mail.app: &#8220;<code>Mail &gt; Hide Mail</code>&#8220;</li></ul></li>
</ol>

<p>The one-half tiny way? Well, if you&#8217;re feeling <em>really</em> ballsy, you could just just <em>Quit Mail.app</em> for a few hours and, uh, just go <em>work</em>. Yeah, I know: your world would <em>implode</em> if you had two hours without email. You&#8217;d be fired, jailed, or might even miss that whole thread about lunch at Chili&#8217;s vs. Applebee&#8217;s. Friend, someday you will actually hear yourself defending your email addiction as a necessity, and it will seem very very weird to you. Bet me on it.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, suck it up and just check for new mail as seldom as your job and your patience will possibly permit. Really push the envelope on this, even just for half a day, and see if you don&#8217;t notice a difference. The world actually can spin without you for a while (but just a little while).</p>

<p>Because I promise you there&#8217;s always. more. email. coming. You are the single individual in this entire universe who gets to decide how often you deal with an inbox that is utterly bottomless. Own that, and you&#8217;ve taken the most important step toward using email as a tool (instead of the other way &#8217;round).</p>
