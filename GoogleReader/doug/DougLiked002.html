<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>It took both the telephone and the mobile phone 15 years to amass 100 million users, but Facebook did it in 9 months. We see more and more people becoming connected on online social networks, and it seems our networks are growing exponentially. But the reality is, social networks rarely add to our number of connections. We&#8217;ve already met almost all the people we&#8217;re connected to on social networks. We&#8217;re already connected to these people offline. Social networks simply make the connections visible. For example, we often connect with old school friends, and catch up over a couple of wall posts. But rarely do we continue the conversation once we&#8217;ve connected, and over time we forget that the connections exist. In fact, Facebook users often have no interactions with up to 50% of their connections.<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn1">1</a></sup> When we study how people are interacting on social networks, we see that most interactions are with a very small subset of the people we&#8217;re connected to.</p>

	<p>The average number of friends on Facebook is 130, and many users have many more.<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn2">2</a></sup> Yet despite having hundreds of friends, most people on Facebook only interact regularly with 4 to 7 people,<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn3">3</a></sup> and for 90% of Facebook users, 20% of their friends account for 70% of all interactions.<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn4">4</a></sup> We also see this with phone usage. We have hundreds of people in our phone contacts, yet 80% of phone calls are made to the same 4 people. We know dozens of people who use Skype, yet 80% of Skype calls are made to 2 people.<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn5">5</a></sup> Even when people play computer games online, they mostly play with people they know offline.<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn6">6</a></sup></p>

	<p>We also have varied interactions with the people we&#8217;re not as close to. We find out about new jobs, not through our friends, but through friends of friends. When our friends&#8217; friends&#8217; friends lose weight, we lose weight.<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn7">7</a></sup> We go onto eBay and buy things for hundreds and thousands of dollars from people we&#8217;ve never met, and will probably never interact with again.</p>

	<p>We have many diverse relationships with the people in our lives, yet the web doesn&#8217;t support this very well.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/files/banda/designing-for-social/pauladams_fig1.jpg" width="700" height="289" alt="the web doesn&#39;t support different layers of relationships very well" title=""></p>
	<p><i>On Facebook (left), all my &#8220;friends&#8221; are treated equally. I&#8217;m presented with a long alphabetical list. Some of these people I would trust with my deepest secrets, and there are others that I&#8217;ve met less than five times. Yet they are grouped together in a big bucket of &#8220;friends&#8221;. Of the people who are &#8220;friends&#8221; with me on Facebook, there are many that I wouldn&#8217;t call a &#8220;friend&#8221;. I may call them an acquaintance, or a colleague, or even a family member, but they&#8217;re not in the same category as my closest friends.</i></p>

	<p><i>In my phone (right), all my contacts are treated equally. I&#8217;m presented with a long alphabetical list. My best friend is given the same number of pixels as someone I haven&#8217;t spoken to in 5 years. I may be able to access my most frequently contacted people via a &#8216;Favorites&#8217; tab, but these people are still presented in the same way as the people I&#8217;ve lost touch with. On LinkedIn (right), all my connections are treated equally. Yet I have worked with some of them every day for years, and there are others that I met once at a conference.</i></p>

	<p>Our social web tools must start to understand the strength of ties, that we have stronger relationships with some people than with others. And with this knowledge they need to adapt.</p>

	<p><b>There are three kinds of relationship ties:</b><br><ul><li>Strong ties: People we care deeply about.</li><li>Weak ties: People we are loosely connected to, like friends of friends.</li><li>Temporary ties: People we don&#8217;t know, and interact with temporarily.</li></ul></p>

	<p>Let&#8217;s look at each type of tie, and how we might design for them.</p>

<h3>Most people have less than 10 strong ties</h3><br>For decades, people have talked about social networks being made up of strong and weak ties. Think of the people in your life. Think about your closest friends, the people you are closest to in your family. These are examples of your strong ties. Strong ties are the people you care about most. People often refer to strong ties as people in their &#8220;circle of trust&#8221;. Strong ties often wield the most influence over people&#8217;s decisions. <br>
	<p>Most people have very few strong ties, usually less than ten. A study of 3000 randomly chosen Americans showed that the average American has just four close social contacts (four strong ties). Most Americans have between two and six strong ties. People&#8217;s strong ties come from a variety of places. About half of the strong ties are said to be friends. The other half includes spouses, partners, parents, siblings, children, co-workers, fellow members of clubs, neighbors, and professional advisors and consultants.<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn8">8</a></sup> In both 2002 and 2007, a study of 1,178 adults found that on average, people had about 10 friends they meet or speak with at least weekly (10 strong ties).<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn9">9</a></sup> So, when we&#8217;re designing for strong ties, we&#8217;re designing for small groups of people.</p>

	<p>Some people believe that this is changing, that the web is making us closer to more people.<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn10">10</a></sup> On the contrary, research studies have shown that the vast majority of usage on social networks is between strong ties. As we saw earlier, on Facebook it&#8217;s with 4 to 6 people, with phone calls its with 4 people, and with Skype it&#8217;s 2 people. When people play online computer games with others, they are mostly interacting and playing with people they know, often with people who live less than a few miles away. This pattern of technology being used for strong tie communication is not new. When the telephone was invented, it did more to expand and strengthen strong ties than to weaken them. A study in the 1970s showed that the majority of phone calls were to people who live within five miles of the caller&#8217;s home.<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn11">11</a></sup></p>

	<p><b>When designing for strong ties:</b><br><ul><li>Think about their existing means of communication. Phone calls, text messages, email. Strong ties already have established ways to interact, we should support them, and not try and replace them with our own messaging systems.</li><li>Showing more information about the ten closest people is likely to be much more valuable than showing less information about many more people.</li><li>Avoid generic terms such as &#8220;Friends&#8221;. This will likely lead to over-populating groups and reducing their relevance.</li><li>Suggest connections to people, but communicate the effects of adding new connections.</li></ul></p>

<h3>People have about 150 weak ties that they stay up-to-date with</h3><br>Moving away from your strongest ties, think about some of your friends&#8217; friends. People you don&#8217;t know so well. These are examples of your weak ties. Weak ties are people you know, but care less about. These are the people that are loosely connected to you. Weak ties are people you wouldn&#8217;t feel uncomfortable stuck in a elevator with, yet don&#8217;t feel much emotional closeness to. <br>
	<p>In the 1970s, the sociologist Marc Granovetter wrote a seminal paper about the strength of weak ties. He concluded that weak ties are often a much better source of information than strong ties. As our strong ties are a very small circle, weak ties can be a more powerful source of information and advice. Studies show that most people can only stay up-to-date with 150 weak ties in real life. This pattern has been true for thousands of years. Neolithic villages tended  to separate into two once they reached 150 inhabitants, the Roman army was split into groups of 150, so that everyone knew each other.<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn12">12</a></sup> It is still true today, online and offline. We are connected to many more than 150 weak ties, but don&#8217;t stay in touch with them. We may be connected to hundreds of people on Facebook, but we would struggle to tell anyone what is going on in all of their lives.</p>

	<p>In social networks, weak ties can sometimes be very useful, for example, connections on LinkedIn can help you find a new job, a friend of a friend can give you advice on a specific topic. Yet sometimes, weak ties on social networks can lead to awkward social situations, for example, receiving unwanted Facebook invites from people you don&#8217;t know very well.</p>

	<p><b>When designing for weak ties:</b><br><ul><li>Consider the trade-off between communication and trust. Weak ties may be more knowledgeable about something we&#8217;re interested in, but we may trust them less. It may be important to show our other shared ties, or expose their sources of knowledge, so that we can increase the trust between people.</li><li>Make it easy for people to expose their networks to people they trust with that data. This will open up links between weak ties, without compromising user privacy.</li><li>Enable appropriate communication channels between weak ties. It may be better to go through, or highlight, a shared strong tie.</li></ul></p>

<h3>The web is increasing our interactions with temporary ties</h3><br>Strong and weak ties are not enough when we think of relationships online. We need a new category of tie &#8211; the temporary tie. <br>
	<p>Temporary ties have always existed, but the web is bringing them to the fore. Think about some people you&#8217;ve only interacted with once. You don&#8217;t actually know who they are. A store assistant, a call center employee, the person you bought from on eBay. These are examples of your temporary ties. Temporary ties are much more common online than offline. They are people that you have no recognized relationship with, but temporarily interact with for a specific reason. Once the task has been completed, temporary ties are unlikely to interact again. You don&#8217;t know these people beyond the words they typed, and whatever online profile they have. With the rise of online user generated content, temporary ties are becoming more important.</p>

	<p><b>Following are four common types of temporary ties:</b><br><ol><li>People sometimes interact with temporary ties around an <b>information need</b>. People needing information seek people with knowledge of the answer. Once the request for information has been fulfilled, interaction with these ties usually ceases. You may ask a person in the street for directions, or online you may seek information from people on Yahoo! Answers. This type of temporary tie is increasingly important for the future of web search. People are looking to other people, rather than businesses, to answer certain queries.</li></ol></p>

<li>Temporary ties also exist when people need to temporarily interact to <b>complete a task</b>. Once the task is completed, interaction ceases. For example, interacting with a sales assistant in a shop, or having a plumber in your house to fix a leaking pipe. Many of these tasks are now online, for example interacting with a call center representative to arrange cable installation, or buying something from a temporary tie on eBay.</li>
<li>Temporary ties can form around a <b>shared ongoing interest</b> such as a sports team or hobby. Interaction can often happen on a community website, for example a sports team forum. The true identity of these ties can remain unknown. One some of these sites, frequent posters start to recognise each other and each other&#8217;s behaviour. Although they likely have never met, their relationship can move from temporary tie to weak tie. There are an increasing number of examples where temporary ties interact online, and meet offline.</li>
<li>People often form temporary ties with people sharing the same physical space. These ties can be as simple as a 1 minute conversation on the street, or as complex as an intermittent 3 day conversation at a music festival. Technology now allows us to communicate with temporary ties who shared the same physical space with us, albeit not at the same time. We can use our phones to see who has previously been to the restaurant we&#8217;re considering, what they ordered, and whether they thought it was any good.</li><br>Because we have no relationship history with our temporary ties (unlike with our strong and weak ties), representing identity and reputation are critical for successful interactions. We need to know that the eBay seller is trustworthy. We need to know that the medical advice we&#8217;re reading is from an actual doctor, and not someone pretending that they are a doctor. We need to know that the restaurant review is from someone who knows about food, and that the Amazon review wasn&#8217;t written by a company employee.<br>
<p><img src="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/files/banda/designing-for-social/pauladams_fig2.jpg" width="700" height="187" alt="reputation building" title=""></p><i>On Yahoo Answers, people can build their reputation in different ways. On the left, &#8220;Messykat&#8221; is building her reputation by trying to provide the best answers to questions. She may be helpful in 20% of cases, but we still don&#8217;t know much about her credentials as an expert in any of her 3 specialty areas (Cats, Dogs, Weddings). On the right, &#8220;RuthAnn&#8221; is trying to build her reputation by stating that she &#8220;has been training dogs for 40 years&#8221;. This only adds a superficial layer of credibility, as we can&#8217;t verify if it is true.</i><br>
<p><img src="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/files/banda/designing-for-social/pauladams_fig3.jpg" width="700" height="214" alt="building trust by positive feedback from temporary ties" title=""></p><i>On eBay (left), &#8220;jmjenkins&#8221; is building trust by getting positive feedback from temporary ties who have dealt with him in the past. Some of these people have also left positive comments on his profile, e.g. &#8220;Item just as described, arrived safe and sound. Thanks! A++&#8221;.</i><br>
	<p><i>On Amazon (right), &#8220;W.Todd Dominey&#8221; is building his reputation by providing helpful reviews in 665 of 711 cases. He is also building trust by using his real name, and sharing where he is from. However, as with &#8220;RuthAnn&#8221; on Yahoo Answers, we don&#8217;t know how much &#8220;W.Todd Dominey&#8221; knows about the topic being reviewed. We can&#8217;t verify his credentials.</i></p>

	<p>The motivation for most people who help their temporary ties is not monetary. You can&#8217;t create a great temporary tie community with financial reward. Yelp tried to do this by paying people $1 per review, and later they tried to build communities by paying people $15 an hour to comment on existing reviews and write new ones. Yelp ended up with a lot of poor quality reviews <sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn13">13</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn14">14</a></sup>, and a lot of bad press. Some of the <i>actual</i> motivations for temporary ties include recognition of being an expert, altruism, and feeling that they belong to a community. All of these behaviors need to be understood and accounted for in our social web designs.</p>

	<p>Supporting temporary ties is good for business. One study showed evidence that &#8220;an increase in positive comments about a mobile handset typically appeared a month or two before an increase in market share for that handset.&#8221;<sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn15">15</a></sup> Another study over 7 months showed that when the online promoter activity (an estimate of the online chatter likely to lead to a recommendation) went up, sales went up the following month. When activity went down, sales went down. <sup><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn16">16</a></sup></p>

	<p><b>When designing for temporary ties:</b><br><ul><li>Prioritize a great system for building reputation. Allow people to give feedback to one another.</li><li>Encourage people to expose content that will increase trust in their identity. This could be their real name, a real photo rather than an avatar, or proof of their qualifications.</li><li>Prioritize a great system for building trust between people. This may be highlighting shared connections, shared groups, or shared interests.</li><li>Don&#8217;t incentivize people with money, incentivize them to build their reputation.</li></ul></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3><br>Social web design will become an important part of every interaction designer&#8217;s skillset. To do it well, we&#8217;ll need to understand some basics about human relationships. If your users&#8217; needs center around strong ties, you&#8217;ll design something very different than if they center around temporary ties. Understanding the difference between strong, weak, and temporary ties will help us build better online social experiences.<br><br>

<p>Have you seen Disney Pixar&#8217;s movie <a href="http://www.weddingchicks.com/wedding-chicks/engagement-sessions/37401/disney-pixars-up-engagement-shoot/?preview=true&amp;preview_id=37401&amp;preview_nonce=d3c3a25bfa">UP</a>? Every time I see this movie I cry no matter what. It is quite touching. So, when <a href="http://www.wildflowersphotos.com/">Wildlfowers Photography</a> shared with us this adorable engagement shoot we were so excited to share it with you!</p>
<p>The idea of this photo shoot came from Lynnette and James.&#160; Their favorite movie is&#160;<a href="http://www.weddingchicks.com/wedding-chicks/engagement-sessions/37401/disney-pixars-up-engagement-shoot/?preview=true&amp;preview_id=37401&amp;preview_nonce=d3c3a25bfa">UP</a><em> </em>so they wanted an engagement shoot based around the movie. Below is a sweet and touching letter that James wrote  to Lynnette and so kindly shared with <a href="http://www.wildflowersphotos.com/">Wildlfowers Photography</a> and we are going to share it with you&#8230; break out your hankies&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lynnette&#8230; I have a confession, I am in love with you. &#160;It is not the  &#8216;usual&#8217; love, but the love that makes me remember the little things, the  &#8216;boring&#8217; things. &#160;It is the boring things in life that I will remember  the most. &#160;The memories of jumping over sidewalk cracks to how the  clouds talk to us. &#160;You make me remember the moments. &#160;It is that love  that makes me believe. &#160;Belief that I was there when you were a  toothless kid. &#160;Dancing through life, only stopping to hold my hand.  Letting me know that anything is possible. &#160;I am in love with you, &#8216;my  greatest adventure&#8217;. &#8211; James&#8221;</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p><br>
Ice Cube was on Jimmy Fallon&#39;s show a couple weeks ago and before taping began, he joined the house band the Roots to warm up the audience with a live version of N.W.A&#39;s 1988 classic, <a href="http://rapradar.com/2010/06/09/ice-cube-x-the-roots-%E2%80%9Cstraight-outta-compton%E2%80%9D-footage/">&quot;Straight Outta Compton.&quot;</a> Drummer Questlove put a video of the performance up on his <a href="http://www.twitvid.com/0QJ9Z">Twitvid</a> account last night. It&#39;s of a very different feel than the original. The Roots&#39; MC Black Thought and guitarist Kirk Douglas wear suits (!) as they handle Ren and Eazy-E&#39;s verses, respectively. And the avoidance of profanity is jarring. (Black Thought raps that he&#39;ll &quot;find a good piece of <em>mush</em>/And go up in it,&quot; which is far more offensive, actually, than the real word that goes there.) But still, as it&#39;s own thing, musically, like Questlove says at the end, Damn, that shit was dope.         </p>

<p>Stephanie Casper, a design student at the Pratt Institute, knitted a few meats.  They&#8217;re shrink-wrapped, so as long as they haven&#8217;t been out of the fridge too long, they&#8217;re probably safe to cook and eat.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.timflach.com/">Tim Flach</a> takes portraits of animals, many of which are dogs. His expressive portraits are much like human portraits rather than snaps of dogs in their natural habitats. There is an emphasis on the traits of the particular kind of dog he is photographing almost as if he is trying to exaggerate what is already there. I can&#8217;t imagine what it is like to get that <em>one great shot</em>, especially with an animal who is far less cooperative than a human!</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>I have always tried to believe in karma. What you put out you eventually get back. If you try your best to be good, eventually you will be rewarded. If you spend your life fucking people over, hurting those around you, eventually that will come back to you too.</p>
<p>So as I&#8217;m sure you locals know my father flipped the fuck out. I&#8217;m not just talking about the flip the fuck out that my family and I were used to. I&#8217;m talking giant, public, flaming, news at 11 flip out. </p>
<p>After the initial blitz of crap that came from it where nearly everyone I&#8217;ve ever known or worked with called or emailed or facebooked or whatever&#8217;d me died down I was left with some reflection. In a way it&#8217;s kind of like a giant release. Suddenly all those who wondered why I was always so weird around him, or why I didn&#8217;t seem to care for him understand or at least think they understand. </p>
<p>Now, finally, the ties that bind, those that have been holding us, gagging us for years are severed and I can talk freely. We&#8217;ve spent decades being yelled down, manipulated, and abused into submission and damnit I don&#8217;t have to be quiet anymore. </p>
<p>As I collect my thoughts more, as life settles into this new normal, which is not normal at all honestly, I plan on posting more. It&#8217;s cathartic, but most importantly if it helps just one person then it&#8217;s worth it. I know that out there there are thousands of women who are afraid. Women who don&#8217;t know what they will do to set him off next-  those who don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re good enough because they&#8217;ve spent so long being told about all of their faults and all of the things that they do wrong. I know what it&#8217;s like to not know whether you&#8217;ll make it thru the night without yelling, praying that just one week will go by without a blow up, without the shit being thrown and the fists coming at you.  You are not alone, you can survive it, you can be stronger. </p></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<b>Transcript</b><br>
<blockquote>Dear Todd,<br>
<br>
Thank you for your letter. Here are some general comic strip cartooning tips that I've tried to make helpful for people at all levels of advancement. I hope these will apply to your work. <br>
<br>
1. Materials are not important, so long as your work reproduces and reduces clearly. It's what you do WITH the materials that counts. <br>
<br>
2. I think characters are more important than jokes. Any cartoonist ought to be able to come up with funny gags, but the best strips have rounded, complex characters that readers can care about. Cartoon characters should be more than standing props to deliver jokes. <br>
<br>
3. Don't imitate other strips. Editors are looking for something new and original. <br>
<br>
4. Most importantly, have fun with your work, and practice writing and drawing all you can. <br>
<br>
Good luck,<br>
<br>
(Signed, 'WB Watterson')<br>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p></p><p>In reading about the lives of history&#8217;s great men, one thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that many of them had a place they could go to be alone with their thoughts. Some of these men had a study where they would retreat to think, read, and write. Others had a garage or workshop where they would tinker and experiment. But what all these rooms had in common was their sheer manliness. They were <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2010/01/10/the-decline-of-male-space/">man spaces</a>, places a man could call his own.</p>
<p>Below we give you a look inside the man rooms of 14 famous men from history. Within these rooms they formulated ideas that would change the world, wrote books that remain classics, and revitalized the dynamic manliness that drove their success. While we all can&#8217;t have a Carnegie-esque study, perhaps you&#8217;ll find inspiration from these manly spaces to spruce up your own room or simply the push to find a place where you can get away from it all and in tune with your manliness.</p>
<h3>Ernest Hemingway&#8217;s Writing Studio</h3>
<p><img title="hemingway" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/hemingway2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333"></p>
<p>The room where <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/08/11/the-hemingway-you-didnt-know-papas-adventures/">Papa</a> wrote <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls </em>and <em>Death in the Afternoon. </em><a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/08/27/motivational-posters-ernest-hemingway-edition/">Ernest Hemingway</a> lived in this house in Key West, Florida for more than 10 years. Needing a place where he could drink a glass of scotch, smoke a cigar, and write about men being men, Hemingway turned the old carriage house on the property into his personal writing studio. The main features in the room are the Cuban cigar-maker&#8217;s chair and his Royal typewriter. Throughout the room, Hemingway placed mementos he collected from his manly adventures in Africa and Cuba.</p>
<h3>Theodore Roosevelt&#8217;s Trophy Room</h3>
<p><img title="tr" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/tr.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="340"></p>
<p>After Theodore Roosevelt&#8217;s Dakota cattle business failed, he came back East to New York and built a home in Oyster Bay, NY. He called his estate Sagamore Hill, and he lived there until he died (with a stint in the White House, of course). It was where <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/05/17/theodore-roosevelt-motivational-posters/">Roosevelt</a> would go to relax, romp in the woods, and revitalize his man spirit. The crowning manly jewel of the house was TR&#8217;s trophy room where he kept his collection of wild game he had hunted in Africa and throughout the American West. The room has a high ceiling and is filled with rich, dark Philippine camagon woodwork. A perfect place for the manliest president to read a book about <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/29/50-non-fiction-adventure-books/">adventure in the grasslands </a>or to entertain guests and dignitaries.</p>
<h3>Frederick Douglass&#8217; Office</h3>
<p><img title="doug" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/doug.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="235"></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img title="fred" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/fred1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="320"></p>
<p>Frederick Douglass was a true <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2008/12/28/self-made-men/">self-made man</a>. He escaped from slavery and through hard work and self-education, became a writer, publisher, speaker and fierce abolitionist. With the money he made from writing and speaking, Douglass bought a 14 bedroom house in Washington, D.C. that he called Cedar Hill. His office was lined with over 1,000 books on a wide variety of subjects, and his walls were adorned with portraits of people he admired like Susan B. Anthony and Wendell Phillips. Douglas would spend up to five hours a day reading and writing in his manly study. At his sturdy wooden desk he penned many of his <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/07/11/manvotional-self-made-men-by-frederick-douglass/">inspiring speeches </a>and his famous autobiography, <em>The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass.</em></p>
<h3>Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s Study</h3>
<p><img title="jefferson" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/jefferson.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="531"></p>
<p><img title="bedroom" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/bedroom1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331"></p>
<p>The author of the Declaration of Independence also was a master architect. Jefferson designed the home that crowned his beautiful Monticello estate. Jefferson&#8217;s man space was his study where he&#8217;d read about, write about, and ponder liberty and other profound principles in solitude. The busts of great men served as muses for Jefferson. One of the unique aspects of Jefferson&#8217;s man space is how it&#8217;s connected to his bedroom. He placed his bed in an alcove in the wall between his study and room. That way Jefferson could roll right out of bed and start working or if he needed to take a power nap after hours of manly meditation and study, he could lie down for a respite.</p>
<h3>Mark Twain&#8217;s Writing Hut</h3>
<p><img title="twain2" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/twain2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="368"></p>
<p><img title="twain1" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/twain1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="215"></p>
<p>Mark Twain would often summer with his sister who lived in Elmira, New York. Needing a place where he could get some work done, Twain built himself a writing hut on his sister&#8217;s property. Free from distractions and inspired by the setting, Twain could write in peace and quiet. In this sanctuary of manliness, Twain wrote some of his most widely read and manly works: <em>Life on the Mississippi</em>, <em>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#8217;s Court</em>, and <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>.</p>
<p>I love how Twain described his man space in an 1874 letter to William Dean Howells:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is the loveliest study you ever saw&#8230;octagonal with a peaked  roof, each face filled with a spacious window&#8230;perched in complete  isolation on the top of an elevation that commands leagues of valley and  city and retreating ranges of distant blue hills. It is a cozy nest and  just room in it for a sofa, table, and three or four chairs, and when  the storms sweep down the remote valley and the lightning flashes behind  the hills beyond and the rain beats upon the roof over my head&#8212;imagine  the luxury of it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Henry David Thoreau&#8217;s Cabin</h3>
<p><img title="henry" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/henry.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="350"></p>
<p>Tired of the distractions of modern living, Henry David Thoreau went to the woods to live a deliberate and simple life. He borrowed some land near a pond called Walden from friend Ralph Waldo Emerson and built himself a simple 10&#8242;x15&#8242; shack. The inside was furnished with a bed, a table, a desk, and three chairs. That&#8217;s it. Total cost to build his man shack? $28.12. It was in this small hut in the woods that Thoreau would get the inspiration he needed to write his most famous work of Transcendental Philosophy, <em>Walden, Or Life in the Woods. </em>Thoreau&#8217;s rustic man-hut has inspired men for generations to tear out into the woods, build a shack with their own bare man hands, and start sucking the marrow out of life.</p>
<h3>Thomas Edison&#8217;s Library</h3>
<p><img title="edison" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/edison.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300"></p>
<p><img title="ed001a" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/ed001a.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="367"></p>
<p>Many people argue that Thomas Edison&#8217;s greatest contribution to science and technology was his Invention Factory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. This series of brick buildings was the first industrial research and development laboratory and is the model for today&#8217;s corporate and government R&amp;D labs. Nestled in the complex was Edison&#8217;s personal library. The focal point of the room is the roll top desk that Edison likely used to design cool stuff like the phonograph or <a title="Kinetoscope" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoscope">Kinetoscope</a>. Edison knew how to <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2010/02/08/the-world-belongs-to-those-who-hustle/">hustle</a> and would often work for 24 hours (or more!)&#160; straight. He&#8217;d take catnaps in a cot that he set up in his library to recharge himself for more work.</p>
<h3>John Muir&#8217;s Study</h3>
<p><img title="john2" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/john2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"></p>
<p>When John Muir wasn&#8217;t wandering through Yosemite and pondering the awe-inspiring power of nature, he lived with his wife in a 14-room mansion in Martinez, California that had been built in 1883 by his father-in-law. The Muirs occupied that home from 1890 until John&#8217;s death in 1914. This was the most fruitful time of Muir&#8217;s career, and much of his productivity took place within the walls of his study, which he called his &#8220;scribble den.&#8221; Seated at his simple wooden desk, Muir laid much of the foundation for the modern conservation movement, penning hundreds of passionate magazine and newspaper articles and writing books on the importance of preserving nature, mulling over how to save the Hetch Hetchy Valley from being dammed, pushing for the creation of National Parks and a Park Service, and taking care of work for his job as the first president of the Sierra Club.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left">Winston Churchill&#8217;s Art Studio</h3>
<p style="text-align:center"><img title="churchillpainting_color" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/churchillpainting_color.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="240"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">In addition to being a first-class statesman, Winston Churchill was a talented artist as well. The man loved to paint. He loved it so much that he built himself an art studio in his estate&#8217;s garden. When he felt the &#8220;Black Dog&#8221; of depression tailing him, he would retreat to his studio and keep the darkness away by putting brush to canvas.</p>
<h3>Mark Twain&#8217;s Billiards Room</h3>
<p><img title="twain_house_billiard_room" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/twain_house_billiard_room.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="340"></p>
<p>Mark Twain is so manly that two of his man rooms made the list. This billiards room took up the entire top floor of his three-story Hartford, CT house where he lived from 1871-1891. The room was off limits to Twain&#8217;s wife and kids and reserved for Twain and his male guests to shoot pool, smoke cigars, and imbibe spirits. Twain also used the room as a man retreat, a place to write and hide from the domestic chaos on the other floors of the house. Twain explained the reason this special man space was needed in his home:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There ought to be a room in this house to swear in. It&#8217;s dangerous to have to repress an emotion like that&#8230;Under certain circumstances, profanity provides a relief denied even to prayer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>The Wright Brothers&#8217; Bicycle Shop</h3>
<h3><img title="Wright-Bicycle-Shop" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/Wright-Bicycle-Shop.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399"></h3>
<p>The garage or workshop is a favorite place for men to retreat to, drink a beer, and tinker on their car. The Wright brothers spent hours together in their bike shop fixing bikes and creating the first successful flying machine. Their shop actually changed locations several times, but what stayed the same was the industrial utility of the room and the solitude it offered them to ponder how to get man into the air.</p>
<h3>Charles Darwin&#8217;s Study</h3>
<h3><img title="darwin" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/darwin.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400"></h3>
<p><img title="charles" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/charles.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="464"></p>
<p>Located in rural Kent, England, Charles Darwin&#8217;s Down House is where the famous scientist lived and worked for over 40 years. Inside the home, Darwin had a private study where he would write in solitude. Darwin was a morning person and felt he did his best work between the hours of 8 AM and 9:30 AM. It was in this room that Darwin wrote his landmark work, <em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</em>. Darwin lined his shelves not only with books but also with animal specimens he found while taking walks in the afternoons. I&#8217;m totally digging that spiral cane and bowler hat placed on the chair in the first picture.</p>
<h3>Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s Drafting Studio</h3>
<p><img title="frank" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/frank1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="522">Frank Lloyd Wright lived at his Oak Park, IL residence from 1889 until 1909. During these first two decades of his career, Wright developed his architectural practice and style, brainstorming ideas and drafting plans within the handsome home studio he designed himself. Under the octagonal hanging lights, Wright and his associates developed the Prairie style of architecture and designed 125 structures. The magnificent studio is certainly a worthy workplace for such a revered architect; a fellow architect said it offered &#8220;inspiration <em>everywhere</em>.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Andrew Carnegie&#8217;s Study</h3>
<p><img title="carnegie_study" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/carnegie_study1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="397"></p>
<p>Steele magnate Andrew Carnegie used some of his vast millions to build a 64-room mansion located on 5th Ave near Central Park in New York City. Among its 64 rooms were Carnegie&#8217;s private library and study where he would spend his mornings either alone or with his personal secretary. He used his library to receive applicants seeking a piece of his philanthropic treasure chest and his study to determine which ones would get funds. The rooms were decked out in typical Gilded Age furnishings- dark hand-carved wood, plush furniture, and decorative ceilings. Along the walls of both rooms were stenciled Carnegie&#8217;s favorite inspirational sayings like &#8220;The Kingdom of Heaven is within you.&#8221; It&#8217;s pretty amazing what sort of man room you can build when you&#8217;re the richest guy in the world.</p>
