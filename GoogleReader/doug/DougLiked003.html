<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p><a href="http://memeorandum.com/">Memeorandum</a> made some minor markup changes recently which broke <a href="http://waxy.org/2008/10/memeorandum_colors/">Memeorandum Colors</a>, a Greasemonkey script I wrote that colors Memeorandum based on linking behavior.  (<a href="http://waxy.org/2008/10/memeorandum_colors/">Read more</a> about it.)</p>

<p>If you were using Memeorandum Colors, here's the <a href="http://waxy.org/random/scripts/memeorandum_colors.user.js">updated Greasemonkey script</a> and <a href="http://waxy.org/random/scripts/memeorandumcolors.xpi">Firefox extension</a>.  (Unfortunately, it won't work in Chrome because they <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=18857">haven't implemented</a> cross-site requests in user scripts yet.)</p>

<p><br>
Now, a funny story.  On Monday afternoon, I was alerted that the script was broken by a guy named <a href="http://twitter.com/PatinDetroit">Pat</a>, a <a href="http://www.politicalbyline.com/">political blogger</a> in Detroit.  He asked politely if I'd fix the script, and I promised to take a look at it.  I fixed it last night and was cleaning it up for release this morning, when I saw this on Twitter:</p>

<p>I never looked at his site, so was totally unaware of his political leanings. I was just busy.</p>

<p>Enjoy the code, Pat!  Sorry I took so long to fix the code you use and love, for free, every day.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Pat deleted his three tweets (archived above for posterity) and, in an <a href="http://waxy.org/random/images/weblog/patindetroit_twitter_archive.png">epic 17-tweet rant</a>, offered me and five others &quot;an ass kicking that you will never, ever forget.&quot;  He follows up with a threat to sue me for publishing his &quot;likeness and words&quot; &#8212; screenshots of the three deleted tweets above, posted in public, addressed to me, and reproduced for non-commercial commentary and criticism under the Copyright Act&#39;s &quot;fair use&quot; provisions. </p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> And now his Twitter account's gone. I saved <a href="http://waxy.org/random/images/weblog/patindetroit_twitter_archive.png">an archive</a> of his threatening tweets for posterity. If you want to get in touch, his new account is <a href="http://twitter.com/RightBloggerPat">@RightBloggerPat</a>.</p>

<p><strong>August 6:</strong> Pat wrote a <a href="http://www.politicalbyline.com/2010/08/06/fatty-this/">followup on his blog</a>, with his perspective of the whole ordeal.  He admits he jumped the gun and apologizes for the mistake.  Case closed.</p>&#160;</div></div></div><div class='row'>
<div class='item alternatelook'><span class='itemorigin clearfix span8' id = 'item61'><a href='http://minimalmac.com/'>Minimal Mac</a> <br></br> 08/09/2010 10:06 AM</span><span class='itemtitle em'><a href = 'http://minimalmac.com/post/927145531'>Year One</a></span>
<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>Minimal Mac recently rounded the corner of it&#8217;s first year in existence. I think I can safely say that everything about it has exceeded my expectations, mostly because I really had none at the start. I thought I would come up with this little project that a few people might enjoy that discussed the merits of having &#8220;enough&#8221; when it came to technology and, with extrapolation, life. <a href="http://patrickrhone.com/2009/08/05/the-24-hour-idea/">It went from that thought to execution in 24 hours</a>. Here we are, almost 900 posts later, still doing this thing. I won&#8217;t discuss the numbers but, let me suffice to say that more than a few of you show up every day to see what I post and, as a writer and curator, it makes me equal parts humbled and proud.</p>
<p>I hope the coming year will bring even more of the same, yet <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/48588149/better">better</a>. I want to continue to make sure I am working every day to bring a level of quality to the work I produce here that is consistent with my beliefs and abilities. I want to make sure that the subject matter is both topical and rational. I also want to work hard to make sure that anyone who chooses to give me even a moment of their valuable time and attention walks away feeling it is a fair trade and square deal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also hoping to spruce the place up a bit. Perhaps a fresh coat of greyscale paint. Make it look even better on those new fangled devices all the cool kids carry these days.</p>
<p>I thought, especially for those that have not been here since the beginning, an appropriate way to celebrate would be for me to call out some of the posts I think are not only a good overview of the year that was, but are also a reflection of what we believe in:</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>I didn&#8217;t really think the world of advertising was all that fascinating &#8212; until I started watching <em>Mad Men</em> a few years ago.  Now I can&#8217;t get enough.  That&#8217;s why I was thrilled to stumble upon a documentary that premiered at last year&#8217;s Sundance Film Festival called <em>Art &amp; Copy</em>.  It features really illuminating, no-holds-barred interviews with a lot of people who today are considered the pioneers of modern advertising, and who came of age in the <em>Mad Men</em> era.  People like George Lois, the loud-mouthed and brilliant guy who came up with Volkswagen&#8217;s legendary &#8220;Think Small&#8221; campaign.  And the guys who came up with &#8220;Got Milk?&#8221; &#8212; which everyone thought was a dumb idea, until someone realized it was brilliant.  And the guys who did &#8220;Where&#8217;s the Beef?&#8221; &#8212; which the client almost killed a week before it aired, and went on to become one of the most remembered and loved commercials of the past thirty years.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a fascinating look at how much advertising has changed since the sixties and seventies.  Back then, city-dwellers saw an average of about 1,000 ads a day.  Now it&#8217;s more like 5,000.  Isn&#8217;t that insane?  That&#8217;s why 65% of Americans say that they feel &#8220;constantly bombarded by advertisements.&#8221;  Which speaks to another point that <em>Art &amp; Copy</em> and its interviewees argue rather well &#8212; which is that, yes, there are plenty of crappy ads out there, that are offensive and stupid and appeal to the lowest common denominator, but when advertising really works, when it really does all it can do, it rises above crass commercialism and becomes a work of art.  You know those Toulouse-Lautrec prints you see all over the place these days?  A lot of those were posters he made &#8212; advertisements that were printed and pasted around Paris, to try and induce people to come to certain cafes and bars and pay the cover charge.  They were ads, and now they&#8217;re art.  So where do you draw the line?</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>If you pay attention to video game news, you&#8217;ve probably heard a lot of buzz these last few weeks about an indie game called <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/"><cite>Minecraft</cite></a>. Ever since it caught the attention of gaming tastemakers <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/14/minecraft-mine-the-gap-day-1/">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a> and <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/9/17/">Penny Arcade</a>, my online social circle has been <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23minecraft">completely twitterpated</a>. In fact, it has become so extraordinarily popular that the developers have made it temporarily free-to-play in order to prevent overloading their servers.</p>
<p><cite>Minecraft</cite> is a peculiar game that&#8217;s difficult to classify. Its pedigree certainly includes the world-building of <cite>Dwarf Fortress</cite>, the procedural dungeon crawling of <cite>Rogue</cite>, and the undirected creativity of LEGO. While it&#8217;s marvellously simple and intuitive, <cite>Minecraft</cite> is not an easy game to learn. In its current alpha release, it has nothing in the way of guidance or tutorials. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to figure out what to do on your own, making it necessary to follow an external FAQ.</p>
<p>In an effort to help resolve this unfortunate situation, I&#8217;ve put together a small guide to surviving your first day and night in <cite>Minecraft</cite>. There are already a number of excellent walkthroughs for new players available on the game&#8217;s forum, and my advice certainly does not diverge strongly from them. However, if this guide manages to pique your interest then I strongly encourage you to purchase a copy and explore the world of <cite>Minecraft</cite> for yourself.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/01_welcome.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"></p>
<p>Welcome to your very own procedurally generated world! It&#8217;s very pretty and ripe for exploration. However, you shouldn&#8217;t start wandering just yet. When nighttime falls, the land will be crawling with all sorts of dangerous fiends. You need to start gathering the necessary materials to survive the night.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/02_lumber.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"></p>
<p>The first resource you need is lumber. Walk up the nearest tree trunk and begin harvesting it by holding down the left mouse button. The block will eventually break, dropping a log that you can pick up. Chop down a few more trees in this manner until you have collected close to a dozen logs.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/03_crafting.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"></p>
<p>To begin using these logs, they need to be crafted into lumber and sticks. Begin by pressing &#8216;i&#8217; to open your inventory, then click and drag the logs into the crafting window. You will receive four units of lumber for each log you process. Next, drag the lumber into the crafting window in the shape illustrated above (one on top of the other) to create sticks. If necessary, you can split your lumber pile in half by right clicking it.</p>
<p>Crafting is one of the <cite>Minecraft</cite>&#8216;s most fundamental mechanics, but in the alpha version it is very poorly documented. If you&#8217;d like to know more about the sort of things you can craft, I recommend consulting the <a href="http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Crafting">Minecraft Wiki</a>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/04_coal.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"></p>
<p>Coal is the second essential resource for your first night in <cite>Minecraft</cite>. As illustrated in the screenshot above, it looks like black splotches on a rock cube. It&#8217;s most commonly found embedded in sheer rock cliffs and natural cave formations. However, unlike wood, you cannot gather coal with your bare hands; you need to craft a proper tool.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/05_equipment.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"></p>
<p>To make a tool, you need a crafting table to access the 3&#215;3 crafting grid. You can make one by arranging four pieces of lumber in a square. Move the crafting table to the bottom line of your inventory, use the scroll wheel to equip it, and place it in the world by right clicking. Don&#8217;t worry too much about the position, as you can pick the crafting table back up by left-click &#8220;gathering&#8221; it.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/06_mining.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"></p>
<p>Right click the crafting table to access the larger grid, then place your lumber and sticks in the above formation. This will create a wooden pickaxe, a valuable mining tool that tears through rock and harvests certain ores. Equip it (the same way you did the crafting table) and hold the left mouse button to mine the coal. You should also gather some rock while you&#8217;re at it, though it&#8217;s plentiful everywhere.</p>
<p>While pickaxes are fundamental to progressing in <cite>Minecraft</cite>, it&#8217;s worth noting that you can also craft axes, shovels and hoes to speed up your work or swords and armour to protect yourself.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/07_night.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"></p>
<p>By the time you&#8217;ve finished gathering coal, it&#8217;s quite likely that the sun has begun to set. Zombies, spiders and skeletons will begin wandering the land shortly, and you&#8217;re in no shape to fight them with your current equipment. It&#8217;s therefore imperative that you construct some shelter to hide in. Fortunately, all the materials you&#8217;ve been gathering will help you to do exactly that. Use your pickaxe to carve a shallow cave in the side of a cliff. Any location will do, but I advise not wandering too far from your starting point (you&#8217;ll respawn there when you die). For extra safety, wall up the entrance with dirt when you&#8217;re finished.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/08_cave.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"></p>
<p>Of course, noone wants to sit around in a dark cave all night. To get things done, you&#8217;ll need some light. Combine sticks and coal to craft some torches, then place them on the walls to light up the room. Monsters won&#8217;t spawn in lighted areas, so you should place a few outside your abode as well.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/09_furniture.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"><br><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/10_furniture.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"></p>
<p>Since you&#8217;re stuck inside until the sun rises, you might as well get some crafting done. I recommend constructing two particularly useful pieces of furniture. A furnace is made out of rock and consumes fuel (wood or coal) to smelt ore, bake bricks and cook food. A wooden chest provides an abundance of extra storage space. It&#8217;s a great place to keep your more valuable items, as it will protect you from losing them when your character dies.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/11_digging.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"></p>
<p>If it&#8217;s still dark outside, you should start digging a mine and exploring the underworld. You can find rare and valuable ores as you descend, but you&#8217;ll need a better tool to gather them. For now, crafting a pick out of rock will allow you to collect iron. Resist the temptation to dig straight down; you might get stuck or fall into lava. Instead, dig diagonally in a descending staircase shape. If you hit a natural underground cave or dungeon, be sure to explore it (cautiously!)</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/12_iron.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"></p>
<p>Similarly to coal, iron ore appears as tawny patches on rock. Smelting the ore into ingots with your furnace will allow you to craft iron armour, minecarts, buckets, etc. Iron is a very useful metal, but as you dig deeper you&#8217;ll find precious gold, diamond and redstone.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/13_zombie.jpg" alt="" title="Minecraft"></p>
<p>When dawn finally arrives, the morning sun will burn any monsters that are still roaming about (except for explosive <a href="http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Mob#Creepers">Creepers</a>, inexplicably). The land is once again safe to explore, so I recommend taking advantage of the daylight to gather more lumber, hunt wild animals or embellish your residence (<a href="http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/14_mycave.png">here&#8217;s mine at the moment</a>).</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve gotten the basic mechanics down, how you continue to play is really up to you. You could try <a href="http://yfrog.com/n4v0bp">spelunking the depths of the earth</a>, <a href="http://lunaran.com/pics/minecraft_treehouse.jpg">building a treehouse</a> or <a href="http://towardsdawns.blogspot.com/">sailing to distant lands</a>. There are no explicit goals or directives, just a wonderful sandbox of pure undirected play. I hope you have a grand adventure!</p>

<li>You are less interested in a topic when you don&#8217;t foresee being able to talk about it.</li>

<li>You are uncomfortable taking a position of high uncertainty about who is right.</li>

<li>You find it easy to conclude that those who disagree with you are insincere or stupid.</li>
<li>You are reluctant to change your publicly stated positions in response to new info.</li>
<li>You are reluctant to agree a rival&#8217;s claim, even if you had no prior opinion on the topic.</li>
<li><em>More?</em></li>

<p>I&#8217;ve been enamored with the <a href="http://practicalopacity.com/post/1128309974/everything-you-need-to-know-about-a-digital-sabbatical">idea of taking regular &#8220;digital sabbaticals&#8221; for a while now</a> but have not really gotten the gumption to do so fully yet. Sure, there are days when I drop off of Twitter, etc. but I have not done any yet where I completely unplug. Perhaps, it is because I have been thinking of it in terms of a week, or even a weekend. That said, doing it for one day might be a modest way to start.&#160;</p></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<p>Yes, the iBend is yet another iPad stand, but this one is truly remarkable. Weighing in at around the same a sheet of card, and just about as thin, the iBend gains rigidity when it is bent into a curve.</p>
<p>The plastic iBendXL (the smaller iBend is for the iPhone) sips flat. You pull it out and bend it, producing two hooks at the front which grab the bottom edge of the iPad and a gentle curve at the back which creates a flat rest for the iPad to lean on. It reminds me of the fascinating models and diagrams in my old math classroom which showed variously truncated cones, cut by flat planes at different angles.</p>
<p>The iBendXL costs $10, and the smaller iBend is $5. Both are slim enough to be slipped betwixt the iDevice and whatever case contains it, and should be tough enough to last a good long time. What this stand really suggest, though, is a DIY project. I doubt the iBend folks are going to put up a printable PDF template anytime soon, but a rainy afternoon spent with some scissors, card and a French curve should get you pretty close. Available now, in plain colors or in fancy arted-up designs.</p>
