Now, <a href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1616">it all started two Thanksgivings ago</a>, was on - <a href="http://massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=342">two years ago on Thanksgiving</a>, when <a href="http://www.rick-robbins.com/bio.htm">my friend</a> and <a href="http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/guthrie_arlo/bio.jhtml">I</a> went up to visit <a href="http://www.alicebrock.com/">Alice</a> at the restaurant. But <a href="http://www.boston.com/travel/explorene/massachusetts/regions/capecod/articles/2008/02/24/after_alices_restaurants/">Alice</a> doesn't live in the restaurant, she lives in the <a href="http://www.learningfromlyrics.org/alice.html">church nearby the restaurant</a>, in the <a href="http://www.panoramio.com/photo/8900764">bell tower</a>, with her husband Ray and <a href="http://www.arlo.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=13651">Fasha the dog</a>. And living in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/61897811@N00/1306325104/">bell tower</a> like that, they got a lot of <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0105-03.htm">room downstairs where the pews used to be in</a>.  Having all that room, seeing as how they took out all the pews, they decided that they didn't have to take out their garbage for a long time.<br>
<br>
We got up there, we found all the garbage in there, and we decided it'd be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the <a href="http://www.townofgb.org/Pages/GBarringtonMA_Recycling/index">city dump</a>. So we took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,471467,00.html">red VW microbus</a>, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the city dump.<br>
<br>
Well, we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across across the dump saying, "<a href="http://www.learningfromlyrics.org/alice_files/image002.jpg">Closed on Thanksgiving</a>." And we had never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in our eyes we drove off into the sunset looking for another place to put the garbage.<br>
<br>
We didn't find one. Until we came to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=prospect+st+great+barrington+MA+&amp;sll=42.367466,-73.634697&amp;sspn=1.01465,1.551819&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Prospect+St,+Great+Barrington,+Berkshire,+Massachusetts+01230&amp;ll=42.197256,-73.36951&amp;spn=0.007948,0.012124&amp;t=h&amp;z=16">a side road</a>, and off the side of the side road there was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the cliff there was another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile was better than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we decided to throw ours down.<br>
<br>
That's what we did, and drove <a href="http://www.guthriecenter.org/">back to the church</a>, had <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=0VIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;ots=_N0XeL35fz&amp;dq=%22ray%20brock%22%20%22arlo%20guthrie%22&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat</a>, went to sleep and didn't get up until the next morning, when we got a phone call from <a href="http://www.arlo.net/obie.shtml">Officer Obie</a>.  <br>
<br>
He said, "Kid,we found <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2010/07/11/if-i-had-hammer-wapo-hippie-columnist-would-pummel-gop-folk-singer">your name on an envelope</a> at the bottom of a half a ton of garbage, and just wanted to know if you had any information about it." And I said, "Yes, sir, <a href="http://sipseystreetirregulars.blogspot.com/2009/08/typical-case-of-american-blind-justice.html">Officer Obie</a>, I cannot tell a lie, I put that envelope under that garbage."<br>
<br>
After speaking to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Obanhein">Obie</a> for about forty-five minutes on the telephone we finally arrived at the truth of the matter and said that we had to go down and pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and speak to him at the police officer's station.  So we got in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/akma/4022174359/">red VW microbus</a> with the<br>
shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the police officer's station.<br>
<br>
Now friends, there was only one or two things that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/obituaries/william-j-obanhein-alice-s-restaurant-lawman-69.html">Obie</a> coulda done at the police station, and the first was he could have given us a medal for being so brave and honest on the telephone, which wasn't very likely, and we didn't expect it, and the other thing was he could have bawled us out and told us never to be see driving garbage around the vicinity again, which is what we expected, but when we got to the police officer's station there was a third possibility that we hadn't even counted upon, and we was both immediately arrested.  Handcuffed.  And I said "Obie, I don't think I can pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on."  He said, "Shut up, kid. Get in the back of the patrol car." And that's what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car and drove to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/17/AR2006111700448.html">quote Scene of the Crime unquote</a>.<br>
<br>
I want tell you about the town of <a href="http://www.stockbridgechamber.org/">Stockbridge, Massachusets</a>, where this happened here,<a href="http://stockbridgepolice.com/">they got three stop signs, two police officers, and one police car</a>, but when we got to the Scene of the Crime there was five police officers and three police cars, being the biggest crime of the last fifty years, and everybody wanted to get in the <a href="http://www.thescreamonline.com/music/music5-1/arlo.html">newspaper story about it</a>. And they was using up all kinds of cop equipment that they had hanging around the police officer's station. They was taking <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/impression-evidence2.htm">plaster tire tracks</a>, <a href="http://www.crime-scene-investigator.net/footwear.html">foot prints</a>, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1913987,00.html">dog smelling prints</a>, and they took twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us.  Took pictures of the approach, the getaway, the northwest corner the southwest corner and that's not to mention the <a href="http://www.landsat.com/stockbridge-massachusetts-aerial-p607749.html">aerial photography</a>.<br>
<br>
After the ordeal, we went back to the jail.  Obie said he was going to put us in the <a href="http://www.arlo.net/pictures/alices/arlo5.JPG">cell</a>.  Said, "Kid, I'm going to put you in the cell, I want your wallet and your belt."  And I said, "Obie, I can understand you wanting my wallet so I don't have any money to spend in the cell, but what do you want my belt for?"  And he said, "Kid, we don't want any hangings."  I said, "Obie, did you think I was going to hang myself for littering?" Obie said he was making sure, and friends Obie was, cause he took out the toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself over the head and drown, and he took out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend the bars roll out the - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5mPc3UXu3w">roll the toilet paper out the window, slide down the roll and have an escape</a>.  <br>
<br>
Obie was making sure, and it was about four or five hours later that <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901591,00.html">Alice</a> (remember <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16357141">Alice</a>? It's a song about <a href="http://jamarattigan.livejournal.com/351910.html">Alice</a>) Alice came by and with a few nasty words to Obie on the side, bailed us out of jail, and we went <a href="http://www.speechwriting.com/lauralee/trinity%20trivia.htm">back to the church</a>, had a <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/alices-restaurant">another Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat</a>,and didn't get up until the next morning, when we all had to go to <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/courtsandjudges/courts/southberkshiredistrictmain.html">court</a>.<br>
<br>
We walked in, sat down, Obie came in with the twenty-seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, sat down.  Man came in said, "All rise."  We all stood up, and Obie stood up with the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/volchok7/3189577778/">twenty-seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures</a>, and the judge walked in sat down with a <a href="http://www.seeingeye.org/">seeing eye dog</a>, and he sat down. We sat down. Obie looked at the seeing eye dog, and then at the twenty-seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, and looked at the seeing eye dog. And then at the twenty-seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one and began to cry, 'cause Obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_justice_(concept)#Blindfold">blind justice</a>, and there wasn't nothing he could do about it, and the judge wasn't going to look at the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us.  <br>
<br>
And we was fined $50 and had to pick up the garbage in the snow, but thats not what I came to tell you about.<br>
<br>
I came to talk about <a href="http://www.sss.gov/lotter1.htm">the draft</a>.<br>
<br>
They got a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/realestate/10scapes.html">building down New York City</a>, it's called <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D91E30F936A35750C0A963958260l">Whitehall</a> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/08/01/2004-08-01_where_recruits_no_longer_fee.html"> Street</a>, where you <a href="http://www.landscaper.net/images/drftnote.gif">walk in</a>, you get injected, <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/dumlao/MDST361/images/0024.jpg">inspected</a>, <a href="http://www.comnet.ca/~pballan/C7P1.htm">detected</a>, infected, neglected and <a href="http://www.vietnamwardraftlottery.com/phpnuke/index.php">selected</a>.  I went down to get my <a href="http://www.landscaper.net/images/physnote.gif">physical examination</a> one day, and I walked in, I sat down, <a href="http://bluematter.blogspot.com/2009/11/dodging-vietnam-draft.html">got good and drunk the night before</a>, so I looked and felt my best when I went in that morning. `Cause I wanted to look like the all-American kid from New York City, man I wanted, I wanted to feel like the all-, I wanted to be the all American kid from New York, and I walked in, sat down, I was hung down, brung down, hung up, and all kinds o' mean nasty ugly things. And I waked in and sat down and they gave me a piece of paper, said, "Kid, see the <a href="http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/combatphsych/section1_7.htm">psychiatrist</a>, room 604."<br>
<br>
And I went up there, I said, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NzFJxX8yoY">Shrink, I want to kill.  I mean, I wanna, I wanna kill.</a>  Kill.  I wanna, I wanna see, I wanna see blood and gore and guts and veins in my teeth.  Eat dead burnt bodies. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-dodge-a-draft/step5/Go-crazy-Dont-mind-if-I-do/">I mean kill, Kill, KILL, KILL.</a>" And I started jumpin up and down yelling, "KILL, KILL," and he started jumpin up and down with me and we was both jumping up and down yelling, "KILL, KILL."  And the seargent came over, pinned <a href="http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/decorations.aspx">a medal</a> on me, sent me down the hall, said, "You're our boy."<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXzX7QCZ8QQ">Didn't feel too good about it</a>.<br>
<br>
Proceeded on down the hall, getting more injections, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2006/10/27/AliceRestaurant_061026120654056_wideweb__300x237.jpg">inspections</a>, detections, neglections and all kinds of stuff that they was doin' to me at the thing there, and I was there for two hours, three hours, four hours, I was there for a long time going through all kinds of mean nasty ugly things and I was just having a tough time there, and they was inspecting, injecting every single part of me, and they was leaving no part untouched.  Proceeded through, and when I finally came to the see the last man, I walked in, walked in sat down after a whole big thing there, and I walked up and said, "What do you want?"  He said, "Kid, we only got one question. Have you ever been arrested?"<br>
<br>
And I proceeded to tell him the story of the <a href="http://www.illustratorworld.com/users/e/ec/echox/a1158.jpg">Alice's Restaurant Massacre</a>, with full orchestration and five part harmony and stuff like that and all the phenomena,  and he stopped me right there and said, "Kid, did you ever go to court?"<br>
<br>
And I proceeded to tell him the story of the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and the paragraph on the back of each one, and he stopped me right there and said, "Kid, I want you to go and sit down on that bench that says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_waiver">Group W</a> .... NOW, kid!!"<br>
<br>
And I, I walked over to the, to the bench there, and there is, <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/od/armyjoin/a/criminal.-u59.htm">Group W's where they put you if you may not be moral enough to join the army after committing your special crime</a>, and there was all kinds of mean nasty ugly looking people on the bench there.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/volchok7/3188645359/in/set-7215761240769424">Mother rapers.  Father stabbers.  Father rapers!  Father rapers sitting right there on the bench next to me!</a>  And they was <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2006/10/01/ING42LCIGK1.DTL">mean and nasty and ugly and horrible crime-type guys</a> sitting on the bench next to me. And the meanest, ugliest, nastiest one, the meanest father raper of them all, was coming over to me and he was mean and ugly and nasty and horrible and all kind of things and he sat down next to me and said, "Kid, whad'ya get?"  I said, "I didn't get nothing, <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattle911/archives/186357.asp">I had to pay $50</a> and pick up the garbage." He said, "What were you arrested for, kid?" And I said, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/06/14/state_laws_are_tough_on_littering_but_they_are_rarely_enforced/">"Littering</a>."  And they all moved away from me on the bench there, and the <a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/hairy-eyeball.html">hairy eyeball</a> and all kinds of mean nasty things, till I said, "<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2007/06/arlo_guthrie_is.html">And creating a nuisance</a>."  And they all came back, shook my hand,and we had a great time on the bench, talkin about crime, mother stabbing, father raping, all kinds of groovy things that we was talking about on the bench.  And everything was fine, we was smoking cigarettes and all kinds of things, until the Sergeant came over, had some paper in his hand, held it up and said.<br>
<br>
"Kids, <a href="http://delawarenationalguard.com/join/army/warrant/pdf/Moral%20Waiver.pdf">this-piece-of-paper's-got-47-words-37-sentences-58-words-we-wanna-know-details-of-the crime-time-of-the-crime-and-any-other-kind-of-thing- you-gotta-say-pertaining-to-and-about-the-crime-I-want-to-know-arresting-officer's-name-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say</a>", and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/volchok7/3189470666/in/set-72157612407694247/">talked for forty-five minutes and nobody understood a word that he said</a>, but we had fun <a href="http://www.usarec.army.mil/hq/warrant/WO_moral_waiver.html">filling out the forms</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/volchok7/3188631435/in/set-72157612407694247/">playing with the pencils on the bench there</a>, and I filled out the massacre with the <a href="http://www.americanprofile.com/article/2896.html">four part harmony</a>, and wrote it down there, just like it was, and everything was fine and I put down the pencil, and I turned over the piece of paper, and there, there on the other side, in the middle of the other side, away from everything else on the other side, in parentheses, capital letters, quotated, read thefollowing words:<br>
<br>
("KID, HAVE YOU REHABILITATED YOURSELF?")<br>
<br>
I went over to the sergeant, said, "Sergeant, you got a lot a damn gall to  ask me if I've rehabilitated myself. I mean, I mean, I mean I'm just, I'm sitting here on the bench, I mean I'm sittinhere on the Group W bench, 'cause <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pws/60s/types.html">you want to know if I'm moral enough</a> to  join the army, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_Massacre">burn women</a>, <a href="http://vietnamphotography.com/image.php?IID=324">kids</a>,  <a href="http://vietnamphotography.com/image.php?IID=118">houses and villages</a> after being a <a href="http://www.northernsun.com/images/imagelarge/Woodsy-The-Owl-T-Shirt%20(8056).jpg">litterbug</a>?"  <br>
<br>
He looked at me and said, "Kid, <a href="http://timelines.com/1967/4/28/muhammad-ali-refuses-induction-into-the-us-army">we don't like your kind</a>, and <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics/iafis/iafis">we're gonna send your fingerprints off to Washington.</a>"<br>
<br>
And friends, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2010/03/29/fbi_cracks_open_door_to_special_file_room/">somewhere in Washington, enshrined in some little folder</a>, is a study in black and white of my fingerprints.  And the only reason I'm singing you this song now is cause <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/chicago7/guthrie.html">you may know somebody in a similar situation, or you may be in a similar situation,</a> and if you're in a situation like that there's only one thing you can do. Walk into the shrink wherever you are, just walk in and say "Shrink, you can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant." And walk out.  <br>
<br>
You know, <a href="http://www.speechwriting.com/lauralee/arq.htm">if one person, just one person does it</a> they may think he's really sick and they won't take him.

And three people do it, three, can you imagine, <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/hdwalk/">three people walking in singing a bar of Alice's Restaurant and walking out</a>. They may think it's an organization.  And can you, can you imagine <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/vietnam_draft.shtml">fifty people a day</a>, I said fifty people a day walking in <a href="http://www.theblogofrecord.com/tag/vietnam-draft/">singing a bar of Alice's Restaurant and walking out</a>.

<p><iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/j0HfwkArpvU?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385" width="640" height="385"></iframe></p>
<p>Here are ten videos, culled from the neverending stream of Internet things that pass by my face each day, ten videos that will make you feel good about the world. They&#39;re all from this year, a year that I can say confidently had way more suck than it had awesome; but if you take half an hour to ignore all the suck and watch these you will come away thinking, man, people still make some beautiful things, even in the midst of shit raining down, even if only they&#39;re tiny little Internet videos. This was a running list I started in January, a list I only added to when moved to do so. And there was not much paring down that happened when I looked back at the collection this week, which proves I have very high standards&#8212;because let me tell you I saw a LOT of cute animal videos this year, and only two made this list. Looking at them all again, it&#39;s clear that I responded to things that were delightful, clever and sometimes poignant. <span></span></p>
<p>1) These are in no particular order, but above is clearly the most wonderful video of 2010: &quot;Words,&quot; by Will Hoffman and Daniel Mercadante, produced for WNYC&#39;s Radiolab program to accompany one of its episodes. It probably takes about a minute for you to go, &quot;Oh, I see what they&#39;re doing here,&quot; and then you&#39;ll go back and watch the whole thing again because now you get it. And for anyone who got out a relationship this year, there&#39;s one shot that might just kill you.</p>
<p>2) The music video for &quot;Red Lights&quot; by the band Holy Fuck elevates the genre of Cats Doing People Things to a level not seen since the 1970s. Indeed, this could be the Internet generation&#39;s <i>The Aristocats</i> or <i>The Cat From Outer Space</i>. Re-imagining the most famous scene in <i>Bullitt</i> as a dog chasing a cat is a &quot;how did nobody think of this yet&quot; kind of genius, but it comes with a danger. When dealing with the obvious yet undiscovered, the bar is automatically set really high, because the audience &quot;gets it&quot; before they even see it and thus demands an execution on par with their expectations. The filmmakers here, Brian Borcherdt and Michael LeBlanc, they do not disappoint.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/DhaRkWfaq10?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385" width="640" height="385"></iframe></p>
<p>3) A couple filmmakers out of Weehawken, New Jersey wanted to get the attention of HBO, so they made a promo spot for &quot;Boxing After Dark,&quot; totally on spec. HBO, turns out, didn&#39;t give a damn. But a lot of other people did, and Liam O&#39;Neil and Jason Koburov found themselves pursued by a number of top talent management firms in Hollywood, who thought they should be in the feature film business instead of the making commercials for free business. It&#39;s easy to see why, since their video, &quot;I Still Have A Soul,&quot; tells a compelling story in just two minutes.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/14462246" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/14462246">HBO &quot;I Still Have A Soul&quot;</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/paradisesquare">Paradise Square Films</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>4) This year&#39;s British elections didn&#39;t quite rouse the spontaneous mass creative impulse that characterized the Obama campaign of 2008, but this video made by &quot;nathankw,&quot; a fan of the Lib Dems, wins out over that sappy Will.I.Am video any day.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/aaruPtx-eFM?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385" width="640" height="385"></iframe></p>
<p>5) Creating things for the love of creating things basically defines the Goddamn Cobras Collective, a group of Brooklyn twenty-somethings with day jobs who all get together in their off hours to produce stuff. They have a whole series of local bands doing live covers of popular songs while a bunch of friends sit around and enjoy the performance. This one, &quot;Wakey! Wakey! part 2,&quot; is perhaps the most endearing. It&#39;s a cover of &quot;Ambling Amp&quot; by Yeasayer, all warm and beautifully shot and, damn, I wish I got invited to parties like these. Replacing the synthesizer with a violin was a great idea.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D9805303%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D0%26show_byline%3D0%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D07ad4f%26fullscreen%3D1%26autoplay%3D0%26loop%3D0&amp;width=640&amp;height=360" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>6) Hey, remember the Olympics this year? Probably not. (It was a Winter Olympics. Hmm.) But some people really cared about them. Like this group of musicians dressed in the traditional clothing of ethnic Tatars, playing authentic Tatar instruments, and singing a cover of &quot;We Are The Champions.&quot; In one of the Tatar dialects.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/7tyaXaemxsA?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=505" width="640" height="505"></iframe></p>
<p>7) Just about everyone on the Internet saw this one, I&#39;m sure, but Patrick Jean&#39;s &quot;Pixels&quot; can be watched again and again without any loss of delight. Classic 8-bit arcade games invade Manhattan. Fantastically clever.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/ugV6cLgwomo?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385" width="640" height="385"></iframe></p>
<p>8) &quot;Oops&quot; won this year&#39;s Vimeo award for best experimental video. Chris Beckman took a bunch of footage of people dropping their cameras while shooting with them, then he edited it all together quite seamlessly. Is it a commentary on our perpetually imperfect relationship with technology? Eh, probably not. But it&#39;s damn compelling and more than a little hypnotic.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D13788278%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D0%26show_byline%3D0%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D00ADEF%26fullscreen%3D1%26autoplay%3D0%26loop%3D0&amp;width=640&amp;height=480" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/13788278">oops</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/chrisbeckman">Chris Beckman</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>9) Ok Go could probably have three videos on this list. They &quot;get&quot; the Internet. But I&#39;m going with &quot;White Knuckles,&quot; directed by Trish Sie, as the best of the bunch, because it features the choreography of trained dogs.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/nHlJODYBLKs?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385" width="640" height="385"></iframe></p>
<p>10) My sardonic cousin refers to <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> as the most successful powerpoint deck ever created. That&#39;s the issue with environmentalist message movies, they&#39;re often pretty boring. Or, as in the case of <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i>, just plain stupid. But neither can be said about Ramin Bahrani&#39;s &quot;Plastic Bag,&quot; which follows the journey of a pollutant through the pollutant&#39;s own perspective, humanizing it, making you sympathize with it, until you feel sad for its very existence&#8212;not for the sake of the Earth, mind you, but for the sake of the pollutant itself. It&#39;s a new twist on the old message of vampire books and ancient mythology. Being immortal&#8212;or, in this case, non-biodegradable&#8212;really kind of sucks.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/YDBtCb61Sd4?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385" width="640" height="385"></iframe></p>
<p>BONUS! Of course you finish up your best of the year list and then something pops up at the last minute and warrants inclusion. So here&#39;s number eleven on my top ten list. &quot;Dueling Cameras&quot; by Adam Lisagor and Noah Kalina, skating in at the end of the year. Adam wrote about the video, &quot;halfway through [production], I realized that it&#39;d been the first time in a long while I&#39;d made something just for the hell of it. And I remembered how good that feels.&quot; That seems like a pretty good place to end. And also a sentiment that sums up the spirit behind everything on this list. Happy New Year, everyone!</p>

<p>The name of Wrex&#8217;s Titanium Adjustable Pocket Wrench just about sums it up, bit it&#8217;s the details that make this stand out. After all, at $180, why would you use this instead of just stowing a regular adjustable wrench in your pocket?</p>
<p>The wrench part is adjusted by a thumb trigger: press it in and slide the ratcheted T-section out, release the trigger to lock. The range runs from 0.1 inches to 0.805 inches, or 2.54 &#8211; 20.447 mm. That&#8217;s enough for any bolt on your bike, although getting enough leverage with the short handle may make it tricky to get those wheel nuts off.</p>
<p>If you pop the T-section out all the way, you&#8217;ll get a sharp surprise &#8212; there&#8217;s a knife in there, which is removable for replacement and TSA compliance. Also in the body is a flat/Philips screwdriver bit and the ever-essential bottle opener. The whole thing dangles from a cord, making it the most manly necklace available.</p>
<p>the CNC-machined tool is made from titanium and stainless steel, and weighs in at a pocket (and neck) friendly 2.9 ounces (82g). Available May.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljpj1yRs8s1qz5dkl.png"></p>

<p>Earlier this week AIGA sponsored a round-table discussion with every designer on Twitter called <a href="http://www.onedayfordesign.org/">One Day for Design.</a> As expected, it was a cacophony of noise with the occasional delightful or insightful nugget. It was less discussion and more a match of wits battling in profundity (with a bit of jest directed at the whole thing too). The event wound up, to my eyes, not so much a dialogue, but more a sequence of soundbites trying to be strung together into a dialogue. I feel for the moderators who were given the impossible task of trying to make sense of the mess and herd cats. They are smart, capable people that were put in a weird spot with a tough job.</p>

<p>Part of this has to do with the format. It&#8217;s very difficult to have a &#8220;listening state&#8221; on Twitter, and great conversations seem to be built more on listening than speaking. On top of that, Twitter is a difficult mechanism to corral into a conversation because it doesn&#8217;t let you curate tweets into a linear sequence of events. Twitter handles back and forth between 2 and 3 people relatively well, but breaks once more people involved. Twitter seemed like the wrong place for the discussion, because it presented a conversation on design that required holistic thinking in a fragmented manner.</p>

<p>In spite of this, I perceive there still to be value to the event. Even though Twitter does not seem to be an ideal mechanism in the search for answers to complex questions, it can be an important tool for raising the appropriate questions on the minds of the masses. Encouraging designers to speak their thoughts on design is an excellent way to get the pulse of the industry. And, in response, I saw some questions and points that delighted me and others that fatigued or even saddened me.</p>

<p>I feel compelled to present a few designers&#8217; poisons. In my opinion, these are the dispositions and mistakes of the field that I saw both addressed as problems and manifested in behavior in One Day for Design&#8217;s live stream. These are the things that hurt all of us. I am not above or excluded from any of these points. In fact, I&#8217;m more guilty than most in some of these.</p><p>This list is an incomplete one, but I presume a partial list is better than not collecting them at all. I present these as my contribution to the discussion about creating a way forward for the profession. There are a few proposed answers in here, but they are given in the spirit of discussion rather than authority. We&#8217;re all part of the same profession, and the AIGA is correct in recognizing there are important issues that need to be addressed that have a great influence on the future of our profession.</p>

<ol><li><strong>A lack of definition for design.</strong> Isn&#8217;t it a bit ironic that a group of communicators can&#8217;t summon a definition for their practice? I won&#8217;t pretend that finding this definition is easy. We&#8217;ll never achieve absolute clarity in a definition, but it doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t strive to define the practice. This lack of definition creates so many of the issues faced by designers both internally and externally. I&#8217;ve a hunch that it&#8217;s not as easy as &#8220;problem-solving,&#8221; because &#8220;problem&#8221; is as sticky of a word as &#8220;design.&#8221; Generally, we&#8217;ve done such wonderful work branding our clients, and such a poor job branding ourselves.</li>

<li><strong>The public&#8217;s general understanding of design as a noun.</strong> So much tension happens in client work because many clients believe the value of the designer is the things that they make, the noun. The designer, meanwhile, believes that the core of their value comes from the process, the strategy. The verb; hence the rise of &#8220;design thinking.&#8221; This fundamental disagreement of the placement of value of a designer&#8217;s services creates a lot of misunderstandings.</li>

<li><strong>Not considering design a liberal art, and entrenching ourselves in the opinion that this is a craft for the few, rather than a skill for the many.</strong> If we believe design is such a valuable lens to view the world through and a fantastic mental mode for problem solving, we should open it up to everyone. Not doing so is double-speak.</li>

<li><strong>The miseducation of a designer.</strong> If it&#8217;s wrong for a client to believe the value of design is in the nouns, it&#8217;s also incorrect to educate a designer around nouns. Curriculums shouldn&#8217;t be focused towards teaching software or creating specific artifacts. The education of a designer should not be focused towards working in specific mediums any longer, because those mediums change so frequently and often congeal into one another into new hybrids. Everything is a campaign now. Schools would be wise to focus activity around objectives rather than tasks, because so much of professional work is around objectives too: devising plans to fulfill those objectives, creating a symphony of efforts that work together towards that goal, and then executing those efforts in a way that adds value. By focusing on objectives, curriculum will age better because instructors can be agile about the tools that they teach as the world around the university changes.</li>

<li><strong>Asking the wrong questions.</strong> We shouldn&#8217;t be asking &#8220;Do I need to learn how to program?&#8221; We should be asking &#8220;Would making websites help achieve the goals of our clients?&#8221; More often than not, it will, so we should work towards making ourselves skillful in that enterprise or surrounding ourselves with those that are. The issue is that the question about programming is task based, and the other is objective based. One focused on How, the other on Why.</li>

<li><strong>Designers wanting a seat at the table, but frequently not inviting clients to our own table.</strong> To extend this point: How much more interesting would it have been if several people that frequently commission design were part of the One Day for Design conversation? I suppose there was nothing keeping them out of the conversation, but generally it seemed the event was painted as something for designers. What if AIGA&#8217;s salary survey was complementary to a client inquiry survey? By listening to our clients, we become better at servicing them. In addition to this, it becomes less easy to paint ourselves as victims, which is generally an unsavory disposition for a profession. <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2833-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-coudal-">As Jim Coudal says,</a> if you&#8217;re making fun of your clients at the bar, something is wrong.</li>

<li><strong>The self-serving nature of design.</strong> So much work by designers for designers. I&#8217;m as guilty of this as anyone else (perhaps, even more guilty), but to achieve a resonance and understanding to the value of design, I suggest that we must look to audiences beyond ourselves and prove that value by improving their lives with our work.</li>

<li><strong>Villainizing criticism.</strong> The measure of a mature practice is reflection and analysis. Painting serious criticism of the field as unnecessary or labeling the critics as second-class because they don&#8217;t &#8220;make anything&#8221; cuts the development of field off at the knees. Criticism and creation have a symbiotic relationship. It is reflexive. Criticism provides a valuable rudder to the mode of making, and to eliminate it leaves us floating. </li>

<li><strong>Undervaluing philosophy.</strong> This one seems odd, but I suggest that there is an unexplored gravitas to the work that we do, not necessarily because there is a profound quality to design itself, but rather because of the promises the work makes. The core question of Aristotelian philosophy and ethics is &#8220;What is the good life?&#8221; How is such a desirous question not brought up more frequently in a field that works so much in human wants and desires, a field that so frequently promises happiness not only for its practitioners, but for its audience as well?</li>

<li><strong>Our cognitive bias towards the uniqueness of our challenges.</strong> It is tempting to think that the problems we face are the first time these problems have risen. Not necessarily so. As interaction designers explore the problem to document their work, are they not facing the same problem as an installation artist or a performance artist in their effort to document the work without turning an experience into an image? This challenge is not unique to design, though it feels profoundly stronger here than elsewhere (which is probably another cognitive bias of my own).</li> </ol></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><h2>1.</h2>

<p>Nothing wrecks your living room decor quite like a giant, rented hospital bed.</p>

<p>The one my Dad laid  in for a couple months in the fall of 1974 was an alarmingly stiff and sturdy affair, the frame of which was forged of impossibly heavy iron, with half a dozen jaggy coats of putty-flesh latex paint doing a shit job of concealing the dings and dents kissed by dozens of clutches  of burly rental guys trying to navigate unaccommodating residential doors.</p>

<p>Jammed cattywampus between a teddy-bear brown sectional, an antiqued rococo credenza, and what had until recently been my Father's favorite armchair, the  hospital bed left little room for easy socializing, let alone aesthetic speculation. This was a living room where a very ill person would mostly die soon.</p>



<p>The hospital bed's defining feature was the theoretical ease with which the human trunk  slumped in its top half could be raised or lowered by turning a shitty little crank at the foot of its lower half. Like the bed itself, the shitty little crank was ugly and obtrusive and hard to live with. Mom and I tripped over the crank  a lot.</p>

<p>The theoretically useful but ultimately shitty little crank  made the hospital bed look like those old-timey cars we'd see in  the bad silent movies they showed down at Shakey's Pizza.</p>

<p>Mom and Dad <em>despised</em> the saltines-and-ketchup style of pizza served at Shakey's. To them, LaRosa's  over  on Cheviot had way better pizza plus a pretty good jukebox. But, I <em>really</em> liked Shakey's. They gave away cool styrofoam boater hats with a red paper band that said, "Shakey's Pizza Parlor." Which I thought looked smashing. So, they used to take me to Shakey's.</p>

<p>In practice, the hospital bed's shitty little crank functioned mostly as a recalcitrant and pinch-inducing mechanism for eroding my father's dignity.</p>

<p>Dad would lay in the hospital bed that filled our living room while my Mom slowly cranked. He'd try to make jokes. (Dad had always been the funniest person any of his friends knew.)  The hospital bed creaked. Mom cranked. Dad's tired upper half would haltingly rise and bob with reluctant help from the bed's upper half. Mom sweated at the crank. Dad laid there and watched. Dad couldn't help. He watched. He was in the hospital bed. Mom did all the cranking. Dad watched. He watched while his wife turned a shitty little iron crank, trying impotently to make her best friend just a tiny bit more comfortable as his body worked  to finally  finish eating itself. But, he couldn't help out. I think he wanted to help out. But, he couldn't help out.</p>

<p>She couldn't really help my Dad. My Dad couldn't really help her. But they sure tried.</p>

<p>She cranked and cranked.</p>

<p>I was seven. I didn't know how to help anyone.</p>

<h2>2.</h2>

<p>The last time I saw my Dad, he was in a different hospital bed. That one was a much more functional and aesthetically appropriate unit neatly fitted into an overlit semi-private room in the highly-regarded Jewish Hospital located on E. Galbraith Road. We weren't Jewish. We were just sick.</p>

<p>Frankly, I forget what the crank on the second hospital bed looked like, but I  seem to recall that it  worked just fine.</p>

<p>This was maybe a week before my Dad died.</p>

<p>From what I can gather, he and my Mom had wanted to time things so that I could be with him as long and as late as possible--but not so late that I'd have to see him in the kind of condition I have to assume he was in during the full week he was too ill for his boy to visit him. Pretty bad condition, I'm guessing.</p>

<p>In the almost forty years since Dad's last  week in any hospital bed, my Mom and I haven't talked much about it. If there are things to say about that week, I'm not sure even forty years is long enough to prep for them. I know I'm still not ready. I should ask my Mom if she's ready. She was forty then. Just under half her life ago.</p>

<p>What I do know is my Mom lived by  that second hospital bed most every minute of Dad's last week. Just like she'd been by the first hospital bed in her living room for the months before.  Only now <em>she</em> was the one sleeping on the wrong bed. There are limits to the physical comforts you can offer  a woman who's determined to stay by her husband's second hospital bed until it's time.</p>

<p>But she <em>was</em> there that whole time. Up to the last time my sweet Dad ever said anything to anyone.</p>

<p>As he laid in that second hospital bed, I'm told that the last thing my Dad said to anyone was something he said to my Mom. He told my Mom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take care of The Big Guy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was me. I was "The Big Guy." My Dad always called me "Big Guy," and I always loved when he said that. It made me feel strong. It made me feel tall. It made me know that my Dad and I were  best pals.</p>

<p>I still love knowing I was my Dad's best pal.</p>

<h2>3.</h2>

<p>I don't specifically remember the day  our particular clutch of burly rental guys came out to remove the first hospital bed from our living room. I do remember thinking it was weird how quickly the space   filled with huge floral arrangements, covered dishes and casseroles, and a pack of outdoorsy men with giant red hands who were new to sobbing inconsolably in front of each other.</p>

<p>But, that hospital bed had been heavy. Really heavy. And even though the bed's wheels had been thoughtfully nested in plastic casters, the raw tonnage of the iron motherfucker left permanent dents in our ugly, broccoli-green carpeting. Six breadplate-sized dents that were still there a year and a half later on the day my Mom and I moved out.</p>

<p>We didn't need a house that big for just the two of us. Plus, the living room wasn't much fun to hang out in any more.</p>

<p>Way too big.  Way too big.</p>

<h2>4.</h2>

<p>I don't currently have a hospital bed. I have a modest but very comfortable  regular bed in a regular bedroom where I sleep  with my regular wife. She's my favorite part of the bed.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, our modest but very comfortable bed is not fitted with a shitty little crank. Which is nice for everyone.</p>

<p>And, every single morning at almost exactly 6:00 AM Pacific Time, my three-year-old daughter wakes up, jumps out of her crank-free, regular, big-girl bed, tears out of her regular bedroom, and--even before she gets her hot milk or takes off her pull-up or tells us to turn on <em>Toy Story 2</em>--she dashes into our regular bedroom, runs up to our regular non-hospital bed, and screams, "<strong>DAD-dy! DAD-dy! DAD-dy!</strong>" until I wake up and say, "G'mornin', Sweet Bug! Did you have nice sleeps?"</p>

<p>Sometimes she tells me whether or not she had nice sleeps. Often as not lately, she tells me to make her hot milk and turn on <em>Toy Story 2</em>. Both of which I'm totally fine with.</p>

<p>Thing is, she screams "<strong>DAD-dy!</strong>" like the most impossibly great thing in the world has just happened. Every single morning. Right by my bed. Without a crank in sight.</p>

<p>And, you know what? Something impossibly great <em>has</em> happened.</p>

<p>Because an annoying, rambling, disagreeable little man like me gets to have this alarm clock in piggy-patterned footie jammies run up to a regular, crank-less, healthy-Dad,  non-hospital bed and make him feel like he's <em>The Greatest Thing in the Universe</em>.</p>

<p>Just like I think she's The Greatest Thing in the Universe.</p>

<p>Just like I thought <em>my</em> Dad was The Greatest Thing in the Universe.</p>

<p>And, although I'm confident that I will <em>always</em> think my daughter is The Greatest Thing in the Universe, I'm also all too aware that this feeling will not always be reciprocated in quite that same way or with quite that same enthusiasm that we both enjoy right now.</p>

<p>She won't always run to my bed in footie jammies.</p>

<p>I'll only get that particularly noisy and personalized wake-up call for a little while. And, I only get a shot at it once a day. At almost exactly 6:00 AM Pacific Time.</p>

<p>Then one day? I won't get it any more. It will be gone.</p>

<h2>5.</h2>

<p>Many mornings over the past six months or so, at almost exactly 6:00 AM Pacific Time, I was not in my regular bed. I was not even at home. I was sitting in another building, typing bullshit that I hoped would please my book editor. Who, by the way, is <em>awesome</em>.</p>

<p>And, if I noticed what time it was, I'd always wonder whether my daughter had run into our bedroom yet.</p>

<p>I'd wonder whether she had seen my side of the bed empty again. And, when I thought about my empty spot on the bed and how disappointed she'd be to scream "<strong>DAD-dy! DAD-dy! DAD-dy!</strong>" then see I'm not even there, I'd die a little.</p>

<p>I'd die a  little, because as I thought about her, I'd think about <em>my</em> Dad. And as I thought about my Dad, I'd start thinking about hospital beds with cranks--then on to dents, and covered dishes, and rooms full of sobbing outdoorsy guys, and so on.</p>

<p>But, by then it might be 6:10 am Pacific Time. And I didn't have time to think about my family. Not now, right?  No, I had to keep working. I had to stay in that other  building and   keep typing bullshit that I hoped would please my editor. Who is awesome.</p>

<p>So, I'd type and type. I'd crank and crank. I'd try and try. I'd  want <em>very much</em>  to go home, make hot milk, and watch <em>Toy Story 2</em>. So much, I'd want this.</p>

<h2>6.</h2>

<p>Anyhow, this has been my on-and-off job for the past two years. I type. And, I try to type things that will help and comfort people, but mostly I try to type things that will  please my editor. Who is awesome.</p>

<p>Sometimes I do my job at 6:00 AM Pacific Time. Sometimes I do my job at 5:30 PM or 11:30 AM or really any time in between. Sometimes I do my job while my family goes to birthday parties and holiday dinners and a couple vacations and I don't even know how many (non-Shakey's) pizza nights--all without me. <em>Without Dad.</em></p>

<p>In fact, a depressing amount of the time--really up until this week--I would do my job until I hadn't the slightest idea what time it was or what bullshit I was typing or what my crank was ever meant to be attached to in the first place.</p>

<p>But, even when my shitty little crank was not attached to anything, I did keep cranking. Because, Dads do their job. It's what they <em>do</em>.</p>

<p>They crank. They crank and crank and crank and crank.</p>

<p>Sometimes the cranking made something special that will be really useful to people who badly need the comfort and help. But, a staggering amount of the time, my cranking has produced joyless and unemotional bullshit that couldn't comfort, help, or <em>please</em> anyone. Especially my editor. Who is awesome.  There's no point in doing anything if it doesn't eventually please my editor. Who is awesome.</p>

<p>This has <em>constantly</em> hung over my head. For two fucking years.</p>

<p>But, this has been my job. It's a job I often did late. It's a job I often did poorly. And, it's a job where I often didn't pull my load or live up to even my own expectations and standards. Which is far from my editor's fault.</p>

<p>She's been awesome.</p>

<h2>7.</h2>

<p>Anyhow, I've tried to do my job. But, I've often failed.</p>

<p>I've sometimes failed to make things that will  help and comfort people. And, God knows I've failed to please my editor.</p>

<p>And, worst of all, more often than my heart can bear at 2:34 pm Pacific Time on Friday April 22nd, I know I've failed to be home for several of my daily shot at "<strong>DAD-dy! DAD-dy! DAD-dy!</strong>"</p>

<p>It's now become unavoidably clear to me that I've been doing each of these things poorly. The job, the making, the pleasing, and, yeah, the being at home. And I can't live with that for another day. So, I've chosen which one has to go. At least in the way it's worked to date. Which is to say <em>not</em> working.</p>

<p>I'll let you guess which.</p>

<p>Because, <em>that</em>? That choosing? That's what my book needs to be about. Not about pleasing people. Not about cranking on bullshit. Not about abandoning your priorities to write about priorities.</p>

<p>My book needs to be about choosing a  hard thing and then living with it. Because it's <em>your thing</em>.</p>

<p>But, that part's gone missing for just a little too long now. Certainly not missing from my handsome and very practical rhetoric--it's been missing from my actual life and <em>living</em>. In a quest to make something that has increasingly not felt like my own, I've unintentionally ignored my own counsel  to never let your hard work fuck up the good things. Including those regular people. Including, ironically, the real work. Including any good thing the crank is supposed to be attached to.</p>

<p>So, I'm done fucking that up. I'm done cranking. And, I'm ready to make a change.</p>

<p>I'm not sure precisely what that change will look like, but, at the risk of invoking Godwin's Law, I have a pretty good idea that this particular performance of "Edelweiss" you're enjoying right now may immediately be followed by a dramatic chase, a hopeful escape attempt, and only if I'm extremely lucky, maybe an eventual stride over the Alps.</p>

<p>As I'll explain in a minute, it most likely means I don't have My Book Contract any more.</p>

<p>Who knows? We'll have to see.</p>

<h2>8.</h2>

<p>All I know is tonight's Friday. And, that's Daddy-Daughter Night.</p>

<p>And, my book agent says my editor (who is awesome) will probably cancel My Book Contract if I don't send her <em>something</em> that pleases her&#8230;today. Now. By tonight. Theoretically, I guess...uh...<em>this</em>.</p>

<p>See: my agent very helpfully suggested I send my editor a chapter full of "email stuff." My editor <em>really</em> likes "email stuff." And, it was theorized by my agent that sending this "email stuff" might please my book editor just enough that she  might  not cancel My Book Contract. For now.</p>

<p>Well. If you've made it this far, you, like my editor (who is awesome), will have realized that this is not a chapter of "email stuff."</p>

<p>It's a very long, wooly, histrionic, <em>messy</em> and uncomfortable story about hospital beds, piggy jammies, and styrofoam hats. I seriously doubt it will please my editor. Who is awesome.</p>

<p>So, no, I really hope she doesn't cancel My Book Contract. But, it does occur to me that said contract is the last and only thing my publisher has to intimidate me into doing things I don't want to do. Things I think will harm my book, my integrity, and my life.</p>

<p>Once that threat is made good, the game ends. They can sue me and yell and stuff. Which would suck, but at least no one would be demanding my book have fucking <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/4767165831/where-the-fuck-do-i-begin">pussy willows on the cover</a>. Which, as I sit here,  feels more and more unbearable to me.</p>

<p>In any case, I don't control anything that anyone does. It took a long time for me to really get that.</p>

<p>It's such a funny thing. Threats--like hurricanes and rectal exams--are only scary until they arrive. Once they're over, they're just the basis for funny stories. But, you do nearly always survive them. And, if you didn't survive? It wasn't because of a lack of fear. Like I say, <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2011/03/28/scared-shitless">the universe doesn't particularly care</a> whether you're scared.</p>

<p>Oh, well. I like my editor. She's awesome. I hope she doesn't cancel My Book Contract. I hope we keep working together.</p>

<p>But if it goes away today, tomorrow or further on? Well. As a favorite novelist of mine used to say: "<em>So it goes.</em>"</p>

<p>I'll figure this out tomorrow. Or Monday. Or later. Tonight is Daddy-Daughter Night. And, no fucking way am I missing two in a row.</p>

<h2>9.</h2>

<p>Now, as far as My Goddamned Book? Truthfully? Wanna hear the <em>really</em> complicated part?</p>

<p>This is not me  quitting the book. No fucking way. This is me doubling down on the book--on <em>my</em> book.</p>

<p>I will finish <em>my</em> book very soon. Not because of (or in spite of) any contract, and not because of (or in spite of)  any editor, and certainly not because of (or in spite of) any tacit demand  for empty cranking.</p>

<p>I will finish <em>my</em> book because <em>I</em> want to finish it. Because it is very, very important to <em>me</em> to finish it.</p>

<p>But, again, let's be clear-- what I finish will be <em>my book</em>. And, it will be done <em>my way</em>. And, yes--you <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/12">Back to Work</a> fans knew <a href="http://5by5.tv/afterdark/16">this one was coming</a>--my book will have <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/4767165831/where-the-fuck-do-i-begin"><em>my</em> cover that <em>I</em> choose</a>. It will not have fucking pussy willows or desert islands  or third-rate kerning. It will be, to quote my editor (who is awesome), "<a href="http://cl.ly/3i2d0a122E3F1c1o3J1w"><em>messy</em></a>."</p>

<p>My book will help and comfort the people that <em>I</em> want to reach. And, yes, much like my  editor, my book will be <em>awesome</em>.</p>

<p>I truly hope <em>my</em> book pleases her.</p>

<h2>10.</h2>

<p>So, there you have it. An article that's clearly  not a chapter of "email stuff."</p>

<p>Me? I'm off to prep for "Daddy-Daughter Night."</p>

<p>And, tomorrow morning, unlike last Saturday morning and countless  other days before it, at the crack of 6:00 am Pacific Time, I will be available in my regular crankless bed to ask  my daughter whether she had nice sleeps. And I will tell her and my regular wife that I think they're the Greatest Things in the Universe.</p>

<p>And, maybe after I make hot milk and watch Woody worry about cowboy camp, I may even  think to myself about how proud my funny Dad would be of his pal, The Big Guy. For doing what needed to be done. To be someone special's Dad for as often and as long as he can. Just like he did. Even when it gets hard.</p>

<p>Even when it gets really hard.</p>
