<p><a title="Posts tagged as windows" href="http://lifehacker.com/software/windows/">Windows</a> only: The PC Decrapifier removes crapware--the system-hogging, usually unwanted programs vendors stuff onto new PCs.</p>
<p>You know the drill: You fire up your new machine, only to find the desktop littered with icons and a deluge of pop-ups to install this, register that and update the other. The PC Decrapifier, which is a simple executable that doesn't even require installation, can detect upwards of <a href="http://www.pcdecrapifier.com/removes">50 common programs</a> and optionally remove any of them. Of course, once they're gone, they're gone (unless you have a system-restore CD that includes the shovelware), so be selective about what you delete.</p>
<p>I don't like The PC Decrapifier--I <i>lurve</i> it. It's simple, effective and free. And it's designed for Windows XP and Vista systems; the program very likely won't work with older PCs, according to the developer. Got a crapware sob-story to share? You know where: the comments! <span>&#8212;Rick Broida</span></p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>The <em>New York Times</em> had an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/us/09down.html?em&amp;ex=1178942400&amp;en=e6910805b7eb9afe&amp;ei=5087%0A">interesting article</a> the other day, by <strong>Amy Harmon</strong>, on how more advanced and widespread testing for Down Syndrome is leading to a shrinking population of babies born with this condition. As evidence, the article cites <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=10521836&amp;query_hl=1&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum">research</a> finding that 90% of parents choose to abort when they are given a diagnosis of Down Syndrome.</p>
<p>I suspect, though, that many parents of children with Down Syndrome would say that raising that child is incredibly rewarding. As a parent, I have found that the greatest pleasures are in watching your child achieve a goal. It doesn&#8217;t matter what; it can be anything. Being up on stage in a first-grade play, buying a trinket at the store by herself for the first time, riding a bike. It is always especially touching when a child overcomes obstacles. A shy child goes off on her first sleepover, for instance. My guess is that the underdog nature of a child with Down Syndrome makes the little accomplishments that much more satisfying for their parents.</p>
<p>When we took my son Andrew to the emergency room just after his first birthday, we were told he had meningitis, likely viral meningitis (which is less serious than bacterial meningitis, which is what it turned out he had). A doctor told us that one possible complication was permanent deafness. Although up to that moment in my life I would have felt awful about having a deaf child, within an instant I embraced the idea that Andrew could be deaf, and in my mind began making plans to learn sign language and thinking about how we would adjust our lives to make his life the best it could be. Life would be harder for him; but as a parent, that just made my job more important.</p>
<p>We were not so lucky, ultimately, to have a deaf child. <a href="http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/andrew.html">Andrew</a> died a few days later.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm"><strong>Dan Gilbert</strong></a> has written a great book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400077427/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-3589668-9026244?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1178812444&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Stumbling on Happiness</em></a>, much of which is about how people are extremely bad at judging in advance what will make them happy in the future. I am pretty sure that, were I faced with a Down Syndrome diagnosis, I would probably lean towards an abortion. But if my wife instead carried the birth to term, I suspect that raising that child would be the most fulfilling thing we would ever do.

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>Seven tips on how to run a successful community. </p>

<p>Every year or so I write a long post or do a presentation at a conference on the subject of community. Each time I approach the subject, I take what I've already written and add to it with recent things I've learned or learned long before and only recently realized. To prepare for an upcoming presentation, I decided to write down stuff I've learned/realized in the last 12 months. I suspect I'll be revisiting this topic many times on this blog but I wanted to kick off this first foray into community with a list of stuff I've been thinking about recently, but haven't written much about yet. If you want a list of introductory tips, one of my first essays was <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/building_an_online_community/">this one from 2001</a>. Consider this more of a list of advanced tips.</p>

<p>Before we get started, first I want to rant a bit. I <em>hate</em> the term User Generated Content. I never use the phrase when talking about this stuff and I'll never use it when writing about it. I consider it a pejorative that reveals a lot about the person saying it. It makes members of your site feel like dutiful robots, crapping content that you convert into cash. The proper (respectful) term is <em>community</em>, and running one is a real challenge. If you're building a community you have to love what you're doing and be the best member of it. It takes great care and patience to create a space others will share and you have to nurture it and reward your best contributors. It's a decidedly human endeavor with few, if any, technical shortcuts. Ok, back to the tips.</p>

<p><strong>1. Take emotion out of decisions</strong></p>

<p>It goes without saying that if you want to run a successful community, you have to be extremely patient with people and give them second chances and the benefit of the doubt. It's also vital to the health of the community that you don't make rash decisions or even rational decisions that can appear as if you were acting on impulse. For communities run by just one person, this can be a challenge. No matter how patient you are, inevitably someday you'll encounter a user trolling the site for laughs, or someone copying your RSS and/or design, or making false claims on your own site, and your impulse will be to lash out at the user causing problems, to ban their account, and delete stuff they've written.</p>

<p>For the first 3 or 4 years of MetaFilter, I succumbed to emotion from time to time, usually late at night after a long day or first thing in the morning before I had fully woken up. I'd read something (or misread, as often is the case with simple text that doesn't convey the way in which something was meant) and take it personally or take it the wrong way and tear someone a new one. The usual result was me looking like an ass and a bunch of members disagreeing with me and a little while later I'd realize I messed up and apologize.</p>

<p>Once I got other moderators on board, this became much, much easier to do. Whenever something on the site irritated me, I now had someone to bounce it off of. Other moderators often hadn't seen whatever got under my skin and could often give an impartial judgment on whether or not anything should be done about it. If you don't have other moderators, it's a good idea to instead sit on decisions you make when you're feeling reactive. After a few years of making occasional mistakes, I'd take to waiting until morning if I saw something late at night that I didn't like. If it was first thing in the morning, I'd purposely put off the decision until lunchtime. In almost every case, by the time I revisited something, other members had dealt with it or I would realize I read something the wrong way at first.</p>

<p><strong>2. Talk like a human, not a robot</strong></p>

<p>If you elect to take your own personal emotions out of major moderation decisions, you of course run the risk of going too far. No one wants to follow a community run by a passionless robot.</p>

<p>"Be human" is popular piece of advice I'm reading about and hearing at conferences this year and I'll write more about the subject later on, but it's important that members of your community know the leaders are humans themselves. This advice can manifest in many ways:<br>
<ul><li>When making moderation decisions, don't quote Terms of Service verbatim or legal code. Be honest and phrase things exactly like you would if you were talking to someone standing in front of you. "Hey man, we appreciate your enthusiasm, but what you're doing is uncool because..." is a lot better than "As per the user agreement, you must cease harrassment of other members per Section 10.9.a..."</li><li>Capture errors on your site and make them friendly to users instead of the default language-specific cryptic messages. Put your own email (or a developer's if you didn't program it) on error messages so people can tell you when they spot a bug and help you fix it (of course, you could also automatically send an error dump email to developers on the server side when errors are encountered, but visitors should also have the option of direct contact).</li><li>Be the best member of your site. Lead by example by participating as much as you can in your own community. This is a good way to attract other well-intentioned members of your site and also reminds everyone a real person is behind it all and building the best community they can for everyone. Speak honestly and be supportive of other members. When I think of all the communities I'm a part of, the ones I love are the ones I see the creators using everyday.</li></ul></p>

<p><strong>3. Give people something they can be proud of</strong></p>

<p>If I had to give a reason why most newspaper blogs are filled with cranky screeds posted anonymously, I'd have to say having a generic blank comment form is key. Most every community that I contribute to offers a comprehensive user profile/history page, letting members customize to their hearts content and allow their profile to reflect their personality. When I think of mainstream news, TV, and newspaper sites trying to solicit comments from readers, I've yet to find something close to even a basic community site. The New York Times requires me to register to read most stories, but their blog system gives me <a href="http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/when-looks-deceive/#footer">a blank generic comment form</a> when I want to comment on a blog post.</p>

<p>I'd love to see a large paper like the NYT implement a real community system. Based on my existing NYT login, I'd love if I had a profile page on their site, tied to any comment I left on a blog or <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?frow=0&amp;n=10&amp;srcht=s&amp;query=%22by+Matthew+Haughey%22&amp;srchst=nyt&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0&amp;submit=sub&amp;hdlquery=&amp;bylquery=&amp;daterange=full&amp;mon1=01&amp;day1=01&amp;year1=1981&amp;mon2=02&amp;day2=15&amp;year2=2006">any article I wrote</a> for the paper (I'm sure I'm in the minority here, but there are writers for the NYT that would also be active on the site). Let me list my blog URL and track any posts I make about NYT articles on my profile page (the NYT already has a "most blogged" feature on their site). Feel free to show me ads that would actually make sense (example: I don't live in NYC, but I see NYC ads on the site -- you might want to pitch me home delivery or general ads aimed at out-of-towners) based on my profile.</p>

<p>If you gave readers a real profile page on a real community system at a newspaper site, I suspect the quality of contributions would go way up. Of course, you'd still get trolls and griefers trying to game the system, but the remainder of readers would post more often and post better things. Heck, you could even let readers connect to their friends that also read the site and offer tools useful to members (like "your friends liked the following articles") as well as gain additional traffic from repeat member visits.</p>

<p><strong>4. Bring users in during community decisions</strong></p>

<p>If <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg_Revolt#DMCA_notices_and_Digg">the Digg HD-DVD encryption key fiasco</a> taught us anything, it's that you can't make rash top-down decisions and expect your community to be okay with it. For MetaFilter, I run <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/">an entire forum</a> devoted to discussing the site itself. I float new ideas and new UI enhancements there and anyone else can start a thread about some aspect of the site. When I have to make a tough decision, I mention it in a new thread and get the members' reactions and often tailor the final result based on their feedback. Like <a href="http://blog.getsatisfaction.com/2007/05/03/how-digg-could-have-avoided-a-community-revolt/">the Satisfaction blog described</a>, if Kevin Rose posted something saying &quot;hey we&#39;re kind of between a rock and hard place &#8212; we&#39;ve been threatened with legal action over a post and would like to remove it to comply with the request&quot; there&#39;d still be a bit of an outcry (and that&#39;s why stuff like <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/notice.cgi?sID=3218">Chilling Effects</a> exists), but it would have been nowhere near the reaction they got.</p>

<p>Welcoming the opinions of users gives the community owner(s) valuable feedback and gives members another way to contribute positively to the community.</p>

<p><strong>5. Moderation is a full-time job</strong></p>

<p>Don&#39;t underestimate the amount of work it takes to maintain, moderate, and keep tabs on a community. Often a single person can create, develop, and launch a new community site in just a couple months, and spend the better part of most days fixing bugs and creating new features. Once a community becomes a bustling place filled with thousands of users &#8212; if a single person is still running the community &#8212; chances are they don&#39;t have any time for writing code anymore.</p>

<p>If you've got an existing site/service that you're planning to add a community or social component to, don't expect someone with a full workload to simply take it on and spend a few minutes here and there maintaining it. Your best bet would be devoting someone full-time to the effort.</p>

<p><strong>6. Metrics spread the work out</strong></p>

<p>While moderation is a full-time job, it helps to make the job as easy as possible because moderators never have enough time to police everything. No one can read every single thing posted in every single place on most community websites. If you've ever used craigslist, you've probably seen those innocuous "flag this post" links sprinkled around the edges of postings. I took a page from Craigslist and implemented a simple user flagging system last year on MetaFilter. It's a basic mechanism that gives the community a policing outlet, but beyond the simple act of empowering users to help you moderate a large site, if you build the right toolset you can save yourself loads of time and stress moderating content.</p>

<p>My flagging system records the id of the item being flagged, the person flagging it, and the person that wrote the item. With this data I can create several useful views of the data. The easiest is to simply do a stream of recently flagged items, and use that as a gauge for stuff as it happens. More useful than that is to start grouping things based on total flag votes, then sort by most flagged over a short period of time. This gives a snapshot of recent hotspots and has proved the most useful tool of all. With the item author data, you can also compile lists of all-time problem users as well as most problematic users over the last month. I've found when looking at the past 30 days data, you can easily see if someone made just one or two mistakes in the community (if everyone flagged the same items they wrote) or if they're more of a chronic problem on the site (if lots of people flag dozens of their contributions). All of these tools are available in an admin dashboard-style interface.</p>

<p>On the flipside, I also implemented <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/favorites/all">a favorites system</a> throughout the site and do similar things to help publicize the best bits on the site (favorites are all public, flagging is not). Metrics are tremendously helpful tools that are pretty easy to implement. About the hardest part is figuring out what to do with the data, and writing the necessary SQL queries to get what you need.</p>

<p><strong>7. Guidelines not rules</strong></p>

<p>While it may seem like simple semantics, I personally shy away from trying to run a community based on hard and fast rules, and instead try to steer members into following community norms in looser guideline form. This often works for the majority of members that want a nice, respectful community. Once you start down the path of absolutes and rules you'll quickly end up in two bad places. 1) you'll get the edgecase loving lawyer/engineer types that will argue and interpret rules ad infinitum and break them just to see what happens. These people will drive you crazy. 2) you will find yourself in a situation where you have to make a bad decision you know is unfair, but you have to because it was one of The Rules That Got Broken. Guidelines allow for nuance and though it's hard to scale nuance in a large community environment, it's another way you can run a site like a human and not a lawyerbot.</p>

<p>I've been at both ends of this issue, as a user and a community creator, both with rules and guidelines, and I prefer the loosey goosey guideline approach. Write up a page of things you'd consider "ways to be a worthwhile member of this community" and "things you probably shouldn't do" and explain the approach when needed, but don't bother trying to come up with a hundred bullet points of things you can and can't do because once you go down the path of even a few rules, you'll soon find yourself at the top of a heap of laws that constantly have to be added to in order to please your most argumentative members, while at the same time having those rules hold you back and force you to bring the hammer down on people that accidentally crossed a line.</p></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>The message of Mark Hurst&#8217;s new book, <a href="http://bitliteracy.com/">Bit Literacy</a>: In an age of infinite bits, time and attention are the scarce resources. The solution is to constantly manage your bits with the goal of reaching an &#8220;empty&#8221; state.</p>


<blockquote>

	<p>When bits are infinite, the only way to thrive is to pick up the eraser. This is letting the bits go: always looking for reasons to delete, defer, or filter bits that come our way. Anything else allow the bits to pile up&#8230;Bit literacy is the constant attempt, in a world of bits, to achieve emptiness.</p>


	<p>Emptiness is at the heart of bit literacy, and that may be an unsettling idea. Emptiness often has negative connotations&#8230;We prefer to have something. We live in a culture, after all, where more is better. The symbol of success is abundance&#8230;Things are different in the bit world, where size and quantity don&#8217;t mean much. Bits are abundantly available to anyone with Internet access&#8230;The challenge isn&#8217;t getting more; it&#8217;s making sense of it all, in spite of the glut. The scarce resource is not the bits but our time and attention to deal with them.</p>


</blockquote>

	<p>Hurst offers practical, opinionated advice on how to get to zero. Just like in his <a href="http://www.unclemark.org/">Uncle Mark&#8217;s shopping guides</a>, he doesn&#8217;t shy away from taking a stand. It&#8217;s nice to read someone who says &#8220;do it this way&#8221; instead of being wishy-washy.</p>


	<p><strong>Get email to zero</strong><br>
For starters, empty your e-mail inbox &#8211; get it to a message count of zero &#8211; <a href="http://www.goodexperience.com/blog/archives/000558.php">at least once a day</a>. I&#8217;ve started doing this and it really is a breath of fresh air each time you get to this screen:</p>


	<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/0mail.png" width="437" height="446" alt="no mail"></p>


	<p><strong>Use a bit lit to do list</strong><br>
Hurst advises using <a href="http://gootodo.com/">Gootodo</a> for your bit-literate to do list but I can&#8217;t get enough of the conveyor belt time-sequencing of <a href="http://www.highrisehq.com/tour#tasks">Highrise&#8217;s Tasks list</a>. Either way, a to do list that gets &#8220;hibernated&#8221; tasks out of your way until you actually need to deal with them is a real game changer.</p>


	<p><strong>Prune sources ruthlessly</strong><br>
You have to prune your <span>RSS</span> feeds and other sources ruthlessly. (Hurst cites Richard Saul Wurman who wrote, &#8220;One of the most anxiety-inducing side effects of the information era is the feeling that you have to know it all. Realizing your own limitations becomes essential to surveying an information avalanche; you cannot or should not absorb or even pay attention to everything.&#8221;) So question everything.</p>


<blockquote>Maintaining a healthy media diet requires vigilance about what you&#8217;re consuming. Thus it&#8217;s important to constantly ask the question, &#8220;Is this worth my time?&#8221; at every level: the source (&#8220;Is this source worth my time?&#8221;), a particular issue of the source, an article, even down to the paragraph or section of an article you&#8217;re in. If the answer is &#8220;no&#8221; to any of these, skip it. Move to the next article, or trash the entire issue; and if it happens too often with one source, consider removing it from the lineup altogether.</blockquote><strong>Get faster on the keyboard</strong><br>
<img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/bit-literacy-cvr-175.gif" width="175" height="262" alt="bit lit book" style="margin:0 10px 5px 0" align="left">Speed is also a priority. Use a typing time-saver app like <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/textexpander/">TextExpander</a> or <a href="http://ettoresoftware.com/About%20TypeIt4Me.html">typeit4me</a> to make typing faster. Hurst has over a thousand abbreviation-expansion pairs. One piece of advice I had never considered: Create shortcuts for common misspellings, so &#8220;teh&#8221; becomes &#8220;the&#8221; or &#8220;taht&#8221; becomes &#8220;that&#8221;. He also advises a code like &#8220;ahr&#8221; to yield &lt;a href=&#8221;&#8221;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

	<p>Avoiding the mouse whenever possible is also key. One solution: Set up keystrokes for one-touch access (e.g. F6: word processor, F7: web browser, F8: email, F9: text editor, <span>F10</span>: calendar).</p>


	<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
&#8220;Bit Literacy&#8221; is a healthy motivational tool for anyone having a hard time keeping up with their personal digital avalanche. Even if you already use some of these techniques, chances are some of Hurst&#8217;s advice will give you ideas on how to change your daily practices. And the succint tone and clear advice (it&#8217;s like a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0789723107">&#8220;Don&#8217;t Make Me Think!&#8221;</a> version of <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">&#8220;Getting Things Done&#8221;</a>) make it all easy to swallow.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not one to normally watch safari videos on the Discovery Channel or the like, but this clip of three different animal species crossing paths was amazing. Watch as a herd of buffalo chance upon a herd of lounging lions. The lions attempt to make a meal of a baby buffalo only to meet the resistance of two crocodiles and the buffalo herd returning to save the calf.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>Interesting article about how people tell their stories and think of their past experiences and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/health/psychology/22narr.html?ei=5090&amp;en=f7a067c3ab0d016e&amp;ex=1337486400&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">how that influences their mood and general outlook on life</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>At some level, talk therapy has always been an exercise in replaying and reinterpreting each person's unique life story. Yet Mr. Adler found that in fact those former patients who scored highest on measures of well-being -- who had recovered, by standard measures -- told very similar tales about their experiences.</p><p>They described their problem, whether depression or an eating disorder, as coming on suddenly, as if out of nowhere. They characterized their difficulty as if it were an outside enemy, often giving it a name (the black dog, the walk of shame). And eventually they conquered it.</p><p>"The story is one of victorious battle: 'I ended therapy because I could overcome this on my own,'" Mr. Adler said. Those in the study who scored lower on measures of psychological well-being were more likely to see their moods and behavior problems as a part of their own character, rather than as a villain to be defeated. To them, therapy was part of a continuing adaptation, not a decisive battle.</p></blockquote>

<p>The article goes on to describe the benefits of thinking about past events in the third person rather than in the first person:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a 2005 study reported in the journal Psychological Science, researchers at Columbia University measured how student participants reacted to a bad memory, whether an argument or failed exam, when it was recalled in the third person. They tested levels of conscious and unconscious hostility after the recollections, using both standard questionnaires and students' essays. The investigators found that the third-person scenes were significantly less upsetting, compared with bad memories recalled in the first person.</p><p>"What our experiment showed is that this shift in perspective, having this distance from yourself, allows you to relive the experience and focus on why you're feeling upset," instead of being immersed in it, said Ethan Kross, the study's lead author. The emotional content of the memory is still felt, he said, but its sting is blunted as the brain frames its meaning, as it builds the story.</p></blockquote>

<p>But things like eating disorders and mental illness aren't external forces and thinking about a bad memory as if it happened to a third party is not the truth. The standard model of the happy, smart, successful human being is someone who knows more, works hard, and has found, or at least is heading toward, their own personal meaning of life. But often that's not the case. Self-deceit (or otherwise willfully forgetting seemingly pertinent information) seems to be important to human growth.</p>

<p>Consider the recent findings by a group at Harvard about <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-02/afps-mmw020607.php">the effects of mindset on physical fitness</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The researchers studied 84 female housekeepers from seven hotels. Women in 4 hotels were told that their regular work was enough exercise to meet the requirements for a healthy, active lifestyle, whereas the women in the other three hotels were told nothing. To determine if the placebo effect plays a role in the benefits of exercise, the researchers investigated whether subjects' mind-set (in this case, their perceived levels of exercise) could inhibit or enhance the health benefits of exercise independent of any actual exercise.</p><p>Four weeks later, the researchers returned to assess any changes in the women's health. They found that the women in the informed group had lost an average of 2 pounds, lowered their blood pressure by almost 10 percent, and were significantly healthier as measured by body-fat percentage, body mass index, and waist-to-hip ratio. These changes were significantly higher than those reported in the control group and were especially remarkable given the time period of only four weeks.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just by thinking they were exercising, these women gained extra benefit from their usual routines. The idea of thinking about oneself reminded me of <a href="http://myespn.go.com/blogs/truehoop/0-19-75/Understanding-Allen-Iverson-on-Allen-Iverson-s-Terms.html">Allen Iverson's training routine</a>, which utilizes a technique called psychocybernetics:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Let me tell you about Allen's workouts," says Terry Royster, his bodyguard from 1997 until early 2002. "All the time I have been with him, I never seen him lift a weight or stand there and shoot jumper after jumper. Instead, we'll be on our way to the game and he'll be quiet as hell. Finally, he'll say, 'You know now I usually cross my man over and take it into the lane and pull up? Well, tonight I'm gonna cross him over and then take a step back and fade away. I'm gonna kill 'em with it all night long.' And damned if he didn't do just that. See, that's his workout, when he's just sitting there, thinking. That's him working on his game."</p></blockquote>

<p>What Iverson is doing is tricking his conscious self into thinking that he's done something that he hasn't, that he's practiced a move or shot 100 perfect free throws in a row. I think, therefore I slam. (I wonder if Iverson pictures himself in the first or third person in his visualizations.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2007/marapr/features/dweck.html">Carol Dweck's research</a> looks at the difference between thinking of talent or ability as innate as opposed to something that can be developed:</p>

<blockquote><p>At the time, the suggested cure for learned helplessness was a long string of successes. Dweck posited that the difference between the helpless response and its opposite -- the determination to master new things and surmount challenges -- lay in people's beliefs about why they had failed. People who attributed their failures to lack of ability, Dweck thought, would become discouraged even in areas where they were capable. Those who thought they simply hadn't tried hard enough, on the other hand, would be fueled by setbacks.</p></blockquote>

<p>For some people, the facade they've created for themselves can come crashing down suddenly, <a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/02/cate-blanchetts-relaxed-concentration">as with stage fright</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>He describes the sense of acute self-consciousness and loss of confidence that followed as "stage dread," a sort of "paradigm shift." He says, "It's not 'Look at me - I'm flying.' It's 'Look at me - I might fall.' It would be like playing a game of chess where you're constantly regretting the moves you've already played rather than looking at the ones you're going to play." Fry could not mobilize his defenses; unable to shore himself up, he took himself away.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a slightly different but still related vein, <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/gigerenzer03/gigerenzer_index.html">Gerd Gigerenzer's research indicates</a> that ignoring information is how smart decisions are made:</p>

<blockquote><p>In order to make good decisions in an uncertain world, one sometimes has to ignore information. The art is knowing what one doesn't have to know.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-11/uoo-dds111805.php">Research done by Edward Vogel at the University of Oregon</a> shows the capacity of a person's visual working memory "depends on your ability to filter out irrelevant information":</p>

<blockquote><p>"Until now, it's been assumed that people with high capacity visual working memory had greater storage but actually, it's about the bouncer - a neural mechanism that controls what information gets into awareness," Vogel said.</p></blockquote>

<p>And data from another study indicates that perhaps <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/01/09/MNG6C46SQ01.DTL">one of the things that the brain does best is forgetting</a> ("motivated (voluntary) forgetting", in the words of one researcher):</p>

<blockquote><p>The findings suggest that despite the brain's astonishing ability to archive a lifetime of memories, one of its prime functions is, paradoxically, to forget. Our sensory organs continually deluge us with information, some of it unpleasant. We wouldn't get through the day -- or through life -- if we didn't repress much of it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the way to true personal acheivement and happiness is through lying to yourself instead of being honest, loafing instead of practicing, and purposely forgetting information. There are plenty of self-help books on the market...where are the self-hurt books?</p></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<p>This has been linked around everywhere already, but really: you simply must watch this Rock Band gameplay vid. It plays pretty much exactly as you imagine it does, like Karaoke Revolution laid on top of three Guitar Heroes. But it&#39;s the part at the end that absolutely ruined me just a few seconds ago: the Ending Bonus, where you wail on the guitar and pound on the drums as much as possible before coming back to the final notes. I am so unbelievably pumped for this.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix'><p>One surefire way to sound really really smart is to invoke a law or principle named after some long dead guy (an alive guy is acceptable too, but lacks slightly in smart points).</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/TheLawsOfSoftwareandSoftwareManagement_8DF6/hammurapis.jpg"><img height="240" alt="hammurapis" width="176" align="left" border="0" src="http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/TheLawsOfSoftwareandSoftwareManagement_8DF6/hammurapis_thumb.jpg"></a>This realization struck me the other day while I was reading a blog post that made a reference to Postel&#8217;s law. Immediately I knew the author of this post must be a highly intelligent card carrying member of <a title="MENSA" href="http://www.mensa.org/">MENSA</a>. He was probably sporting some geeky <a title="XKCD" href="http://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a> t-shirt with a <a title="Unix Joke" href="http://xkcd.com/c149.html">lame unix joke</a> while writing the post.</p>
<p>Well friends, I admit I had to look that law up, and in the process realized I could sound just as scary smart as that guy if I just made reference to every <a title="Definition of eponymous" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/eponymous">eponymous</a> (I&#8217;ll wait while you look that one up) &#8220;law&#8221; I could find.</p>
<p>And as a public service, I am going to help all of you appear smart by posting my findings here! Don&#8217;t let anyone ever say I don&#8217;t try to make my readers look good. If you look good, I look good.</p>
<p>Make sure to invoke one of these in your next blog post and sound scary smart just like me.</p>
<h2>Postel&#8217;s Law</h2>
<p>The law that inspired this post...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Be conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jon Postel originally articulated this as a principle for making TCP implementations robust. This principle is also embodied by HTML which many attribute as a cause of its success and failure, depending on who you ask.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s highly charged political environment, Postel&#8217;s law is a uniter.</p>
<h2>Parkinson&#8217;s Law</h2>
<p>Otherwise known as the law of bureaucracy, this law states that...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As contrasted to Haack&#8217;s Law which states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Work expands so as to overflow the time available and spill on the floor leaving a very sticky mess.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Pareto Principle</h2>
<p>Also known as the 80-20 rule, the Pareto Principle states...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For many phenomena, 80% of consequences stem from 20% of the causes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the principle behind the painful truth that 80% of the bugs in the code arise from 20% of the code. Likewise, 80% of the work done in a company is performed by 20% of the staff. The problem is you don&#8217;t always have a clear idea of which 20%.</p>
<h2>Sturgeon&#8217;s Revelation</h2>
<p>The revelation has nothing to do with seafood, as one might be mistaken to believe. Rather, it states that...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ninety percent of everything is crud.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like Sturgeon is a conversation killer at parties. Is this a revelation because that number is so small?</p>
<h2>The Peter Principle</h2>
<p>One of the most depressing laws in this list, if you happen to have first-hand experience with this via working with incompetent managers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just read Dilbert (or watch The Office) to get some examples of this in action.</p>
<h2>Hofstadter&#8217;s Law</h2>
<p>This one is great because it is so true. I knew this law and <em>still</em> this post still took longer than I expected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A task always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter&#8217;s Law.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, you get extra bonus points among your Mensa friends for invoking a self-referential law like this one.</p>
<h2>Murphy&#8217;s Law</h2>
<p>The one we all know and love.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If anything can go wrong, it will</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking of which, wait one second while I backup my computer.</p>
<p>The developer&#8217;s response to this law should be <a title="Defensive Programming" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming">defensive programming</a> and the age old boy scout motto, <em>Be Prepared</em>.</p>
<h2>Brook&#8217;s Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Named after Fred Brooks, aka, Mr. <a title="Mythical Man Month on Amazon.com" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201835959?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=youvebeenhaac-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201835959">Mythical Man Month</a>. My favorite corollary to this law is the following...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, Brook was not a statistician.</p>
<h2>Conway&#8217;s Law</h2>
<p>Having nothing to do with country music, this law states...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Any piece of software reflects the organizational structure that produced it</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put another way...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you have four groups working on a compiler, you&#8217;ll get a 4-pass compiler.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How many groups are involved in the software you are building?</p>
<h2>Kerchkhoff&#8217;s Principle</h2>
<p>This principle is named after a man who must be the only cryptographer ever to have five consecutive consonants in his last name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In cryptography, a system should be secure even if everything about the system, except for a small piece of information &#8212; the key &#8212; is public knowledge.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And thus Kerchkhoff raises the banner in the fight against <a title="Security through obscurity on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">Security through Obscurity</a>. This is the main principle underlying public key cryptography.</p>
<h2>Linus&#8217;s Law</h2>
<p>Named after Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, this law states...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Given enough eyeballs, all </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_bug"><em>bugs</em></a><em> are shallow.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where you store the eyeballs is up to you.</p>
<h2>Reed&#8217;s Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The utility of large networks, particularly social networks, scales exponentially with the size of the network.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep repeating that to yourself as you continue to invite anyone and everyone to be your friend in FaceBook.</p>
<h2>Metcalfe&#8217;s Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In network theory, the value of a system grows as approximately the square of the number of users of the system.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if Reed and Metcalfe hung out at the same pubs.</p>
<h2>Moore&#8217;s Law</h2>
<p>Probably the most famous law in computing, this law states...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The power of computers per unit cost doubles every 24 month. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more popular and well known version of Moore&#8217;s law states...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double in about 18 months.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we&#8217;ve been racing to keep up ever since.</p>
<h2>Rock&#8217;s Law</h2>
<p>I was unable to find Paper&#8217;s Corollary, nor Scissor&#8217;s Lemma, so we&#8217;re left with only Rock&#8217;s law which states... </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The cost of a semiconductor chip fabrication plant doubles every four years.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buy yours now while prices are still low.</p>
<h2>Wirth&#8217;s law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ha! Take that Moore&#8217;s Law!</p>
<h2>Zawinski&#8217;s Law</h2>
<p>This law addresses software bloat and states...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hear that the next version of <em>calc.exe</em> is going to include the ability to read email. A more modern formulation of this law should replace <em>email</em> with <em>RSS</em>.</p>
<h2>Fitt&#8217;s Law</h2>
<p>This is a law related to usability which states...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Time = a + b log<sub>2</sub> ( D / S + 1 )</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in plain English,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and the size of the target.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A well known application of this law is placing the Start menu in the bottom left corner, thus making the target very large since the corner is constrained by the left and bottom edges of the screen.</p>
<h2>Hick&#8217;s Law</h2>
<p>Has nothing to do with people with bad mullets. I swear. Related to Fitt&#8217;s law, it states that...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The time to make a decision is a function of the possible choices he or she has.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in plain math,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Time = b log<sub>2</sub>(n + 1)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems to me this is also a function of the number of people making the decision, like when you and your coworkers are trying to figure out where to have lunch.</p>

You just put together the iTunes playlist of your life, and now you want to slap it on a thumb drive to give your sweetie. You've got a dozens of gigabytes of iTunes music on an external drive at home, and you just want to copy your Top Rated songs to your laptop for listening on the go.  Out of the box, iTunes can't transfer the song files of individual playlists out of your library for playing anywhere other than your iPod. But  an open source Windows utility, called <a href="http://www.ericdaugherty.com/dev/itunesexport/">iTunes Exporter</a>, can do just that.  Whether you're abandoning iTunes entirely or just wanting to copy the contents of your meticulously-created iTunes library to another computer, drive or device, iTunes Exporter is for you.</p><h3>What iTunes Exporter buys you</h3>

<p>iTunes Exporter generates a universal playlist file that's readable by your media player of choice. iTunes stores its playlists in a proprietary XML file that no other music player can read.  Further, if you've got "Keep my music organized" checked inside iTunes, it automatically manages the folder structure where your music is stored (/iTunes directory/Artist Name/Album Name/Song Title.xxx.)  So if you've got the Ultimate Mix Playlist of songs from many different artists and albums, it's impossible to automatically copy those songs to another location, or play that mix with another media player.</p>

<p>iTunes Exporter reads iTunes' proprietary XML file and generates an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3u">M3U playlist file</a> - which pretty much every music player on the planet can read like WinAmp, foobar, and VLC, to name a few.</p>

<p>Additionally, iTunes Exporter copies the actual music files out of iTunes' managed folder structure entirely, which means your MP3's are completely separate and playable by your media player of choice.  iTunes Exporter offers both a graphical interface and a command line interface. <a href="http://www.ericdaugherty.com/dev/itunesexport/">Download iTunes Exporter here</a> - unfortunately the GUI is Windows only, and it requires the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=262d25e3-f589-4842-8157-034d1e7cf3a3&amp;DisplayLang=en">.NET runtime</a>.  (However, the command line interface works on Linux with <a href="http://go-mono.org/">Mono</a> - but iTunes doesn't run on Linux, so that's probably not that useful.)</p>

<h3>The iTunes Exporter GUI</h3>

<p>iTunes Exporter's graphical interface is a piece of cake to use.  Simply launch and walk through the wizard's steps to choose the iTunes playlists to export, where you want your playlist and song files to end up.  Its got an impressive set of options, though, like playlist format (EXT and WPL are supported as well as M3U) and the ability to automatically include or exclude protected or unprotected AAC files. For a preview of what iTunes Exporter looks like, check out the screenshots below:</p>

<p></p>

<h3>The iTunes Exporter command line</h3>

<p>iTunes Exporter also has a command line interface that can specify all the options available in the GUI.  You might want to use the command line to schedule batch exports of, say, your Top Rated songs to your laptop hard drive once a week.  (Here's more on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/feature/hack-attack-using-windows-scheduled-tasks-153089.php">scheduling batch file operations with Windows Task Scheduler</a>.)</p>

<p> The <a href="http://www.ericdaugherty.com/dev/itunesexport/#Using%20iTunes%20Export">iTunes Exporter homepage</a> runs down the command line options in great detail, but to give you a taste, this command would export the "My Awesome Mix" playlist to the C:\iTunesEscape\ directory with an M3U playlist (no line breaks):</p>

<blockquote>
<code>iTunesExport.exe -dir="c:\iTunesEscape" -include="My Awesome Mix"-copyWithIndex </code>
</blockquote>

It&#8217;s almost hoary to mention it, but it&#8217;s one of the few books that changed my life. I&#8217;ve written more about it <a href="http://www.peterme.com/archives/000561.html">here</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=adaptivepat07-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F006097625X%2Fqid%3D1153248298%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">Understanding Comics</a>, Scott McCloud. A brilliant long-form essay on the nature of creativity, how humans process visual information, and the power of narrative.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-People-Henry-Dreyfuss/dp/1581153120/adaptivepat07-20/ref=nosim/">Designing for People</a>, Henry Dreyfuss. Written over 50 years old by America&#8217;s pre-eminent industrial designer, it lays out a user-centered design philosophy long before the phrase &#8220;user-centered design&#8221; entered our professional language. Refreshing clear, straightforward, and free of the BS that clouds much design writing.</p>

These two are required reading for any one involved in communicating visually. (His later two you can pass on.)</p>
<p><a href="http://whobuiltamerica.org/">Who Built America?</a>, The American Social History Project. This CD-ROM, based on a textbook, set the standard for what a multimedia digital book should be. Developed in 1993, it&#8217;s marriage of text, sound, imagery, and, video, along with it&#8217;s engagement with archival sources, still inspires.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Happiness-Alain-Botton/dp/0375424431/adaptivepat07-20/ref=nosim/">The Architecture of Happiness</a>, Alain de Botton. The most recent book on the list, but definitely worth inclusion. A delightful book-length essay on the power that architecture has on our emotional state, fabulously illustrated with perfectly-selected photos.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=adaptivepat07-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0140139966%2Fqid%3D1153249240%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">How Buildings Learn</a>, Stewart Brand. This is one of those books that every IA has read, even though it has nothing to do with IA. Stewart looks at how buildings evolve over time, and his book serves as a reminder that all of us are creating things that people are going to *use*.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=adaptivepat07-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0596000359%2Fqid%3D1153247384%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</a>, 2nd Edition, Lou Rosenfeld and Peter Morville. Still the best &#8220;web design&#8221; book out there, with a strong focus on what it actually takes to build great sites. And I&#8217;m not saying this just because I was a technical editor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interface-Culture-Technology-Transforms-Communicate/dp/0465036805/adaptivepat07-20/ref=nosim/">Interface Culture</a>, Steven Johnson. Getting a little long in the tooth, but Johnson&#8217;s book is the first extended piece of critical writing on the subject of interface and interaction design from the viewpoint of a non-designer. Valuable in recognizing how interface engage with the culture that creates them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cluetrain-Manifesto-End-Business-Usual/dp/0738204315/adaptivepat07-20/ref=nosim/">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> (multiple authors). Written in the midst of Web 1.0, this tract on what it means for businesses to meaningfully engage in business online contains deep truths that still frighten most organizations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Research-Perspectives-Brenda-Laurel/dp/0262122634/adaptivepat07-20/ref=nosim/">Design Research</a>, edited by Brenda Laurel. About half to two-thirds of this isn&#8217;t all that valuable, but the remainder of the book more than makes up for it. Brenda probes the boundaries of research, which is essential as we design for an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shaping-Things-Mediaworks-Pamphlets-Sterling/dp/0262693267/adaptivepat07-20/ref=nosim/">Shaping Things</a>, Bruce Sterling. What happens when everything is, well, information? Bruce delves into the subject of spimes and reorients your view of things in the world. And, hey, I even dug the (oft-criticized) graphic design.</p>
<p>And heck, why just books? Why not also, <a href="http://www.eamesgallery.com/cart/detail_prod.php?id=513">The Films of Charles and Ray Eames</a>? So good. So insightful.</p>
<p>(And, of course, there are the books written by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=adaptivepat07-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0321432061%2Fqid%3D1153247192%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">my</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=adaptivepat07-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0735712026%2Fqid%3D1153249006%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">colleagues</a>&#8230; but those go without saying&#8230;)</p>

You can use the web to find lots of things: information, videos, books, music, games, and yes, even public records. While our most private information can (usually) not be found online, you can track down items like birth certificates, marriage and divorce information, obituaries and licenses on the web. Keep reading to learn where to find public records online. </p><h3>A brief note</h3>

<p>All of the following web sites and methods of discovery are absolutely free, unless stated otherwise. There are many sites out there that advertise themselves as being free, but charge for their services - and they are not providing anything that you can't find yourself. If you do end up having to pay for something, it will most likely be at a physical location (i.e., a courthouse) in order to procure a copy of a particular public record. </p>

<h3>Google</h3>

<p>You can use Google to find a lot of preliminary information about someone. Simply Google their name - "Betsy Wetsy" - and you can start a good trail. If you know what clubs, workplaces, interests, etc. that the person is affiliated with, you can make this search a little bit more productive. You can also use the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/google-school/google-school-phonebook-lookups-139820.php">Google Phonebook</a> to find both addresses and phone numbers (if they're listed); <code>rp 555-121-1234</code> for residential listings, <code>bp 555-121-1234</code> for business listings.</p>

<h3>Zabasearch</h3>

<p>Controversial search engine <a href="http://zabasearch.com/">Zabasearch</a> gives some people <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/search-engines/zabasearch-people-search-100069.php">the heebie-jeebies</a>; however, Zabasearch ONLY returns results from what is already publicly accessible on the web (just all in one place). For instance, Zabasearch returned my last two known addresses complete with phone numbers along with a Google search for my name.  For anything more substantial than that, I was asked to pony up some money for Intelius, a well-known pay-for-play investigative service. No, thanks. Zabasearch is great for finding names, addresses, and phone numbers (and sometimes birth dates) quickly and easily.</p>

<h3>Vital records</h3>

<p>Here are the best vital records mega-sites for starting a vital records search:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/howto/w2w/w2welcom.htm">National Center for Health Statistics: Where to Write for Vital Records</a>: This is the first place I would start when searching for birth, death, marriage, or divorce  information. </li><li><a href="https://www.virtualgumshoe.com/resources/">Virtual Gumshoe Public Records Resources</a>: A large list of public records categories; each link is designated whether or not it's a free or pay-for service.</li><li><a>BRB Publications</a>: A large compendium of links to public records; state, county, and federal.</li></ul>

<h3>Phone books</h3>

<p>If you're looking for something other than an unlisted or cell phone number (yeah, sorry), you can find it online using these directories:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.anywho.com/index.html">Anywho</a>: White pages, yellow pages, international listings, and a toll-free directory.</li><li><a href="http://www.infobel.com/World/">Infobel</a>: A world-wide phone directory; extremely extensive.</li><li><a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Reference/Phone_Numbers_and_Addresses/">Yahoo Phone Numbers and Addresses</a>: a long list of good phonebook databases on the Web.</li><li><a href="http://inter800.com/index.html">Internet 800 Directory</a>: Just enter the name of the product, service, name of the company, or toll-free number. Ex: <a href="http://inter800.com/cgi-bin/kwd800">Nike</a>.</li><li><a href="http://kevdb.infospace.com/home/white-pages/kevdb?kcfg=wpintl&amp;searchtype=intlcountry&amp;otmpl=white-pages/world/countries.htm&amp;qk=500">InfoSpace international dialing codes</a>: Here's a good 'un - look up the dialing codes for almost every geographical location in the world.</li></ul>

<h3>Licenses</h3>

<p>Need to find a professional license for someone? No problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://lawyers.findlaw.com/lawyer/">FindLaw's Legal Directory</a>: State by state database of licensed attornies.</li><li><a href="http://webapps.ama-assn.org/doctorfinder/home.html">AMA Doctor Finder</a>: information on nearly 700K licensed doctors in the U.S.</li><li>You can also do a simple Google search to find other licensed professionals, i.e., <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=oregon+contractors&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">Oregon contractors</a>.</li></ul>

<h3>Obituaries</h3>

<p>You can use the web to find an obituary:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.legacy.com/Obituaries.asp">Legacy.com obituaries</a>: Type in the last name and you'll get a list of newspaper obits along with records from the Social Security Death Index.</li><li><a href="http://ssdi.rootsweb.com/">Social Security Death Index</a>: Type in as much info as you know for better results; a very good tool.</li><li><a href="http://www.deathindexes.com/">Death Indexes</a>: A very extensive state by state (and county) list of death records, death certificate indexes, etc.</li><li><a href="http://www.cyndislist.com/obits.htm">Cyndi's List</a>: Superb list of death and obit sites; ranges from general indexes to locale-specific.</li></ul>

<h3>Criminal</h3>

<p>Criminal records are somewhat easy to track, though it varies by state.</p>

<h3>Miscellany</h3>

<p>There are so many more great sites for public records.  Here are a few more of my favorites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ellisisland.org/">Ellis Island</a>: Completely free research site for Ellis Island information.</li><li><a href="http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/index.html">National Personnel Records Center</a>: The first place to start for military records.</li><li><a href="http://www.nndb.com/">NNDB</a>: "NNDB is an intelligence aggregator that tracks the activities of people we have determined to be noteworthy, both living and dead." Fascinating site.</li><li><a href="http://www.copyright.gov/records/">U.S. Copyright Office</a>: Search records, registrations, and documents; helps to have as much information to start your search as possible.</li><li><a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/wcomp/index.html">Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents</a>: Pretty much what it sounds like; released every Monday.</li></ul>

<p>This list is by no means conclusive.  Got a favorite public records search site?  Please share in the comments. </p>

<p>Although also very popular in East Asia and in other parts of the American continent, baseball is the <strong>quintessential North American sport</strong>, early in the 20th century even labelled the &#8216;national pastime&#8217; of the USA. It remains so today: in the US, the words &#8216;ballgame&#8217; and &#8216;ballpark&#8217; automatically refer to baseball, not to any other sport.</p>
<p>To the disinterested outsider, baseball shares some <strong>vague similarities with cricket</strong> &#8211; not a coincidence, since baseball is an 18th-century development out of earlier bat-and-ball games popular with British immigrants, such as &#8216;rounders&#8217;. This origin is somewhat disputed: some evidence exists for a British game also called &#8216;base-ball&#8217;, as in British novelist Jane Austen&#8217;s &#8216;Northanger Abbey&#8217; (written circa 1800), where some children play it on a village green.</p>
<p>Nowadays, professional baseball in North America is organized in <strong>Major League Baseball</strong>, composed of the National league (&#176;1876) and the American league (&#176;1901). Both are divided in to Eastern, Central and Western divisions. The game has &#8211; or had &#8211; a mainly eastern following: the first major league teams on the West Coast were &#8216;transplants&#8217; from Back East: the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to LA and the New York Giants to San Francisco in 1958. In 1961, the first &#8216;original&#8217; West Coast team was founded: the LA Angels.</p>
<p>This map, indicating all teams in the National and American sub-leagues of Major League Baseball, translates some of the American obsession with baseball into a representation of the supposed &#8216;countries&#8217; of baseball. As with many other team sports, the fan base of baseball teams is to a large extent regional. Unless you&#8217;re of a contrary nature, you <strong>support the local team</strong> &#8211; barring of course that you move, and continue to support your home team as a kind of sentimental link with your place of origin.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of the &#8216;countries of baseball&#8217;, first of the National League:</p>
<p>1. The Atlanta Braves (based at Turner Field in Atlanta, GA): Rule a large swathe of the Southeast.</p>
<p>2. The Florida Marlins (based at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, FL): Most of Florida, including the Panhandle, but excluding the area around Jacksonville (Braves territory) and the Rays&#8217; country.</p>
<p>3. The New York Mets (based at Shea Stadium in NYC, NY): As far as I can tell, Long Island and northern New Jersey.</p>
<p>4. Philadelphia Phillies (based at Citizens&#8217; Bank Park in Philadelphia, PA): Southern New Jersey, chunks of Maryland and only a limited amount of the Pennsyvlvanian hinterland.</p>
<p>5. The Washington Nationals (based at RFK Memorial Stadium, Washington DC): Most of the DC-surrounding area, and a surprisingly large part of the eastern seaboard to the south of DC.</p>
<p>6. The Chicago Cubs (based at Wrigley Field in Chicago, IL): A large country to the east and west of Chicago, completely surrounding the Chicago Sox&#8217;s land.</p>
<p>7. The Cincinnati Reds (based at the Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, OH): A medium-sized nation, hemmed in by the Cardinals, Cubs, Tigers, Indians, Pirates and Braves.</p>
<p>8. The Houston Astros (based at Minute Maid Park in Houston, TX): All of Louisiana and most of southeastern Texas, including of course Houston itself.</p>
<p>9. The Arizona Diamondbacks (based at Chase Field in Phoenix, AZ): Most of Arizona, parts of New Mexico, bits of southern California.</p>
<p>10. The San Francisco Giants (based at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco, CA): A small coastal strip below San Francisco Bay, a large one north of it, all the way through Oregon to Seattle Mariners country.</p>
<p>11. The Colorado Rockies (based at Coors Field in Denver, CO): The only team in Rocky Mountain territory, therefore has a lot of expansion potential.</p>
<p>12. The San Diego Padres (based at PETCO Park in San Diego, CA): Occupies the small strip of southern California hugging the Mexican border.</p>
<p>13. The St. Louis Cardinals (based at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, MO): Rule a big part of the Midwest and South, including Arkansas and parts of Mississippi, Illinois and Tennessee.</p>
<p>14. The Pittsburgh Pirates (based at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, PA): Western Pennsylvania, through West Virginia into western Virginia.</p>
<p>15. The LA Dodgers (based at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, CA): Mid-California, from the coast into southern Nevada.</p>
<p>16. The Milwaukee Brewers (based at Miller Park in Milwaukee, WI): Wisconsin, the whole of Wisconsin and nothing but Wisconsin.</p>
<p>These teams play in the American League:</p>
<p>1. The Baltimore Orioles (based at Oriole Park in Baltimore, MD): The Delmarva peninsula and central Maryland.</p>
<p>2. The Toronto Blue Jays (based at Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario &#8211; Canada): Southern and central Ontario.</p>
<p>3. The Boston Red Sox (based at Fenway Park in Boston, MA): The map doesn&#8217;t show the extreme northeast of the US; one presumes the Red Sox rule the whole of New England.</p>
<p>4. The New York Yankees (based at Yankee Stadium in NYC, NY): Upstate New York and northern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>5. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays (based at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, FL): A relatively small strip of Florida&#8217;s Gulf Coast, dipping into the interior.</p>
<p>6. The Chicago White Sox (based at US Cellular Field in Chicago, IL): No more than an enclave in Cubs country.</p>
<p>7. The Cleveland Indians (based at Jacobs Field in Cleveland, OH): Ohio, with a southern tail.</p>
<p>8. The Detroit Tigers (based at Comerica Park in Detroit, MI): The whole of Michigan, some of it &#8216;dripping&#8217; out south of the state line.</p>
<p>9. The Kansas City Royals (based at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, MO): A good chunk of the geographical centre of the Lower 48.</p>
<p>10. The Minnesota Twins: (based at Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, MN) Minnesota and most of the Dakotas.</p>
<p>11. The LA Angels of Anaheim (based at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, CA): Squeezed small by the Dodgers, Padres and Diamondbacks.</p>
<p>12. The Oakland Athletics (based at McAfee Coliseum in Oakland, CA): Almost denied coastal access by the Giants, this land surrounds the Bay and fans out further inland.</p>
<p>13. The Seattle Mariners (based at Safeco Field in Seattle, WA): Washington State, plus parts of Oregon.</p>
<p>14. The Texas Rangers (based at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, TX): Oklahoma and Texas, minus Astros country.</p>
<p><em>I presume these countries of baseball are more parts fiction than fact. But it would be interesting to hear from fans which borders run true, which are false. This map was sent to me by Lee I.

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>Sunday night/Monday morning August 12/13 is the peak of the annual and much beloved <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2007/11jul_greatperseids.htm">Perseid meteor shower</a>. Meteor showers occur when the Earth gets to a point in its orbit crossed by the orbit of debris from a comet. Comets are basically big ol&#8217; chunks of rock and gravel held together by ice. When the comet gets near the Sun, the ice melts, and debris gets loose. Over time it spreads out along the orbit of the comet. If that orbit crosses ours, then we plow into the debris, which burns up in our atmosphere. Voila! Meteors!</p>
<p>Since this happens when the Earth goes past the intersection of the two orbits, it happens around the same time every year. The Perseids peak when the Earth passes through the debris left over from the comet <a href="http://cometography.com/pcomets/109p.html">Swift-Tuttle</a>. The chunks are relatively dense in the debris field, so we get a lot of meteors, typically 60 or so per hour, maybe more. Only a couple of showers do better (the Geminids in December are good, for example) and since the Perseids peak in mid-August, they are a favorite for northern hemisphere folks.</p>
<p>Even better, there is a new moon this year, so the bright moonlight won&#8217;t wash out faint meteors. You&#8217;ll see more if you go out and look! </p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: because of the orbital geometry, the shower won&#8217;t really pick up until after local midnight (literally, the halfway point between dusk and dawn). Going out right after sunset will just be disappointing. <strong>The later you stay up after midnight the better.</strong> Incidentally, the Perseids have a broad peak: you could go out as early as Friday night or late as Monday or Tuesday night and still see some.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&#8217;t know how easy it is to watch a meteor shower, and think it takes a lot of prep. Nope! Here&#8217;s a simple list of what you need.</p>
<p><strong>1) A wide open sky with a view to the East</strong></p>
<p>This is the biggest consideration. Meteors appear in random spots on the sky and can go from horizon to horizon. The more sky you can see, the more meteors you&#8217;ll see. Try to avoid nearby buildings, tress, and so on. </p>
<p>If you trace the path of the meteors backward, they will appear to radiate from one point in the sky, located in the constellation Perseus (as played by <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0082186/">Harry Hamlin</a>). This is the same effect as when you&#8217;re driving a car through a tunnel and the lights on the walls and ceiling appear to come from the point ahead of you. A good view of Perseus will again up the odds of seeing more meteors. </p>
<p>Perseus is in the east pretty much all night, so a clear eastward view is good. Being able to look in that direction will increase your odds of seeing more meteors. This isn&#8217;t critical, though; just a big wide view is your best bet.</p>
<p><strong>2) Dark skies</strong></p>
<p>Meteors are generally not terribly bright. A few can be blazing, but most are about as bright as your average star, so you want to be away from lights. Your back yard might be fine, but make sure street lights are blocked and your house lights are off. </p>
<p><strong>3) Time</strong></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re outside, it takes about 20 minutes for your eyes to get fully adapted to the dark &#8212; your pupils dilate, letting in more light, and your eye produces a light-sensitive protein called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin">rhodopsin</a>. Both of these take time to fully kick in. So don&#8217;t be disappointed if you see very few or no meteors right away. White light will bleach the rhodopsin, by the way, so if you need some light, use a flashlight with red cellophane covering the front. That will preserve your night vision.</p>
<p><strong>4) A lounge chair</strong></p>
<p>You need to be able to see a lot of the sky for minutes or hours, so you want to be comfortable. A chaise lounge or a folding beach recliner is a big plus. You can lie on the ground with a blanket if you want, but comfort is important if you&#8217;re going to be out for a while. The ground tends to be cold at night, and wet, too. Which reminds me&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>5) Blankets!</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s August, and in the northern hemisphere it can be hot, but temperatures drop at night. You won&#8217;t be moving much, either, so you won&#8217;t be generating much heat. 65 degrees Fahrenheit is <em>cold</em> if you&#8217;re not moving. Also&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>6) A hat</strong></p>
<p>You lose most of your body heat through your head, so a hat helps a lot. Plus, if you have a nearby street light, you can position your hat to block it. I&#8217;ve done that and it works! Added bonus: no mosquito bites on your head.</p>
<p><strong>7) Telescope, binoculars</strong></p>
<p>I recommend <em>not</em> using a telescope. Why not? Telescopes see only a small part of the sky, and meteors appear in random spots. I guarantee the best meteor of the night will happen while you are stooped over an eyepiece, and you&#8217;ll miss it. However, Jupiter is well positioned for viewing, so this is as good a chance as any to do some observing, and I hate to tell people to <em>not</em> take advantage of a nice night! But be prepared to hear everyone else gasp and then mock you for missing <em>the best meteor evah</em>.</p>
<p>Binoculars are better. You can scan the sky, look for interesting things, and still be able to look around quickly if a bright meteor appears.</p>
<p><strong>8) Star chart</strong></p>
<p>Hey, you&#8217;re outside! Why not get familiar with the sky? You can find charts at local bookstores, and online if you do a little searching. Sagittarius, Scorpius, Hercules&#8230; this is a fine time of year to be out looking for cosmic landmarks. </p>
<p><strong>9) Rest</strong></p>
<p>Oh boy, is this one important. It&#8217;s after midnight, you&#8217;re lying down, snuggled in a blanket, it&#8217;s dark, and your eyes are focused on infinity. You start daydreaming a bit&#8230; and the next thing you know, the Sun is rising and you&#8217;re covered in mosquito bites.</p>
<p>Take a nap Sunday afternoon. </p>
<p><strong>10) Friends, family, neighbors</strong></p>
<p>Having other folks with you will help you stay awake, and honestly, the joy and beauty of a meteor shower is best shared. One of my favorite times ever with The Little Astronomer was watching the Leonids shower years ago. She had a blast, and not just because she got to stay up until 3:00 a.m. with her dad&#8230; but then again, that&#8217;s a big part of it, too.</p>
<p><strong>11) An appreciation of what you are seeing.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://meteorshowersonline.com/perseids.html">Read up on meteor showers</a>, <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/leonids.html">what they are</a>, what we&#8217;ve learned from them. Comets orbit the Sun for billions of years, and you&#8217;re seeing tiny parts of them &#8212; most no bigger than a grain of sand &#8212; as they slam into our atmosphere a hundred miles away at speeds of up to 40 miles per second. How cool is that?</p>
<p><strong>12) Wonder</strong></p>
<p>This may be the best thing to bring, and the easiest. Meteor showers are simply wonderful. It&#8217;s a cosmic show, and it&#8217;s free, and it&#8217;s very, very cool.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p><span face="Arial">Any day in which millions of people all over the globe are waiting eagerly to read a book is a good day. Personally, I find it humbling to be witness to such an incredible moment in literary history. We had to sign a memo at work a few weeks ago agreeing that the copies that will be arriving in our branch are not to be displayed, opened, or removed from the premises before the official release date. This was unprecedented. Violation is punishible by termination. They should arrive this morning in our regular Friday shipment and I know several of us are afraid to even see the boxes. I won&#39;t open a copy, but I do want to hold one in my hand. It&#39;s just a book, we understand that, we are literary people - people who get excited over a ten pound copy of the Constitution - but it is also somehow so much more than just a book. It is an event.<br><br>Yesterday my brother mailed me an entire leaked copy but I refuse to read it. The only thing I know for sure is how many chapters the book has. He chose to read it, opting to indulge early rather than have the plot spoiled for him by some other means, so he already knows Harry&#39;s fate. I won&#39;t be opening emails from him for another week at least. The only safe internet site seems to be <a href="http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/">The Leaky Cauldron</a>, which has implemented a very strict spoiler policy. I just hope I don&#39;t stumble across anything anywhere else. I want to read it exactly as the author intended.<br><br>We are huge Potter fans in my family. We&#39;ve gone to every midnight release and showing. We&#39;ve gone to live Pottercasts. We travel the country to go to symposiums: Lumos here in Las Vegas, Prophecy in Toronto, and next year, Portus 2008 in Dallas. And yes, one of us even owns a robe.</span></p>

<p><span face="Arial">What a great day. There is tension and anticipation everywhere. For a book. For a moment in literary history shared by people of every age and of every language, people who will be cheering for you-know-who and people who will be holding their breath and crossing their fingers for good to prevail. For the celebration of a character that so many of us have come to love. For imagination. After so many years of waiting and wondering we will finally have our answers. This is it. Cheers, Harry.</span></p></div></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><div><p>A few months ago I came across <a href="http://www.geni.com">Geni</a>, a genealogy site that offers the slickest trial-to-signup path I&#39;ve seen yet. I wanted to post on Geni, but to appreciate how good a job they do, I thought it was useful to look at old school sites, where&#160;signup is one of many <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2007/05/hurdles_in_the_.html">hurdles to site usage</a>, and new school sites that avoid some of these hurdles through the use of <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2007/05/easing_visitors.html">anonymous accounts</a>. Geni goes beyond all the rest in creating what, in my opinion, is&#160;the most inviting initial user experience for a site to date.</p> <p>Right off the bat, you're cleverly dropped into a family tree that's already partially started: there's a place for you, and obvious points to add your parents. No fanfare is needed to introduce the site or explain what it's for. The very nature of the task's UI makes it obvious that you're building a family tree:</p> <p><img alt="" src="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/042307_0436_Genishowsho1.png"> </p> <p>You're asked for an email address, and in the most compact text imaginable, they define the key points of their privacy policy ("never spammed, never shared").</p> <p>It's not advertised to the user at this point that the email address they enter for themselves will become their user ID on the site. This is revealed the first time the user tries to return to the site. At that point&#8212;the <em>second </em>visit&#8212;the user is asked to sign in with their email address and a temporary password that was emailed separately to that address.</p> <p>The second visit also includes a minor but noteworthy detail: the user is asked to agree to the service's "Terms of Use". This strikes an elegant balance between the ease of use and legal risk. Terms of use generally come in two flavors:</p> <ol> <li>Browse-wrap. The act of browsing the site implicitly signals agreement. Because a user could argue that they didn't notice or were unaware of the site's terms of use, this form of consent is considered comparatively weak. This is generally used for sites that don't require the user to sign up at all. </li> <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_wrap">Click-wrap</a>. You must explicitly check a box or comparable control to indicate that you agree to the terms. This presumably confers stronger legal protection for the site, because it would be harder for a user to claim that they were unaware of the terms.</li></ol> <p><em>DISCLAIMER:&#160;I&#39;m not a lawyer, and you would have to be a complete idiot to base a legal strategy on the content of this blog without consulting an attorney.</em></p> <p>Most services that require accounts go for&#160;click-wrap terms, hence the ubiquitous &quot;I agree to the terms and conditions&quot; check box found on service signup pages. The site feels obligated to obtain explicit agreement because the user and site are forging an ongoing relationship, and each future interaction could increase the likelihood a legal issue might arise. The downside is the &quot;I agree&quot; check box becomes just another hurdle in the way of the user trying out the service, and creates another opportunity for the user to decide they&#39;d rather just walk away.</p> <p>Geni's approach to terms of use strikes a nice balance. You can try out the site once under a browse-wrap agreement, but for future visits you must accept the click-wrap agreement. By that second visit, of course, you've clearly indicated your interest in what the site has to offer, and you're motivated to regain access to the family tree you've already begun to create. So, agreeing to terms of use at that point seems like a trivial matter. In their approach to terms of use, Geni has managed to move one more hurdle from the entrance of the site to somewhere deep within. This incredibly careful attention to detail pervades the Geni user experience.</p> <p>The Geni site is worth checking out for their signup experience alone. The other thing to marvel at their intensely viral proposition. Genealogy lends itself to reaching out to people you know, and they make it drop-dead simple to enter a relative's email address and invite them with a single click. The beauty of this is that you get to offload all the data entry tedium to the one or two relatives in the family that actually enjoy that sort of thing. Everyone in the family receives the benefit of their work&#8212;as does Geni.</p></div></div></div></div><div class='row'>

<p><a href="http://earth.google.com/download-earth.html">Google Earth</a> (version 4.2) now comes with sky imagery, or a &#8220;virtual telescope,&#8221; as <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2007/08/sky-final-frontier.html">Google calls it</a>. Google explains you can now explore star constellations, see planets in motion, or look at supernova explosions. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/technology/22sky.html?_r=2&amp;ref=technology&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">New York Times</a> reports that these images were &#8220;stitched together from more than one million photographs from scientific and academic sources, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Palomar Observatory at the California Institute of Technology and the NASA-financed Hubble.&#8221; To see this in Google Earth, select <em>View -&gt; Switch to Sky</em> from the menu.</p>

<p>Google already has imagery of <a href="http://maps.google.com">earth</a>, <a href="http://moon.google.com">moon</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/mars/">Mars</a> available as online services. Wonder if the sky pictures will make it to the web as well?</p>

<p>Another new feature in Google Earth is the addition of super-high resolution photo content, which you can see by adding the layer <em>Primary Database -&gt; Featured Content -&gt; Gigapxl Photos</em>. Unlike Google Street View, these photos however are only available for a few select places (like buildings), so there&#8217;s not a lot of random fun stuff to be found.</p>

<div class='itemcontent clearfix span5'><p>Reader Hunter sent us the following question:</p>

<blockquote>I know you&#8217;ve dealt a bit with <a href="http://unclutterer.com/archives/2007/05/paper_clutter_begone_part_4.php">managing paperwork</a> and <a href="http://unclutterer.com/archives/2007/04/solving_paper_clutter_part_1.php">paper in general</a>, but I haven&#8217;t seen anything about what to keep in a fireproof box. I&#8217;ve decided I need one (hopefully a small one) and want to be sure that I keep the most important (and only the most important) things in it. Any suggestions? Keep up the good work.</blockquote>

<p>Hunter, this topic is larger than you might imagine. In an attempt to answer your question, I&#8217;m going to break my response into two separate posts: 1. Contents for a fireproof box, and 2. Purchasing literal and digital fireproof boxes.</p>

<p>First, let&#8217;s address what should be stored in a fireproof box. My recommendations are based on what will be the most beneficial to have immediately following a home fire or in an emergency. Most of the items on this list can actually be replaced, but having to replace them will cause you significant time and unnecessary stress.</p>

<p>As a second component to the home fireproof box, I also recommend having a hard-drive stored at an off-site location. In my <a href="http://unclutterer.com/archives/2007/08/reader_question_fireproof_stor.php">next post</a> on this topic, I&#8217;ll discuss the reasoning behind the second system.</p>

<p><b>Items I recommend you store in a home fireproof box:</b></p>
