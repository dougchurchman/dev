Would you sit down for a cup of coffee with me at Starbucks? The answer, unequivocally, is that you<i> </i>wouldn’t. That is simply not a possibility. If we compared our experiences growing up, you will find that for the things that you take for granted, I have sacrificed and exerted huge amounts of efforts to acquire.</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p><p>From the moment I was born, our life’s path swerved away from each other. I was given a rural resident card while you got a city one. If I grew up keeping my rural residence, I wouldn’t be able to work in the city today. I would also be denied social security, and proper medical care. You might ask: “Why must you come to the city? Isn’t the country good enough? The air is fresh, and it’s never crowded.” But the country has no proper healthcare system. During the SARs scare our country seemed to “suddenly” realize that its rural healthcare was completely defunct. Plus, we have a very small consumer market. Because farmers make very little money and can’t afford much, companies refuse to distribute products in our areas. During the New Year only a tiny percent of families can afford the color T.V to watch the New Year’s broadcast. The majority of families are still fighting for their basic survival. This is why I want to be in the city. For the object you were simply born with, this city resident card, I have had to fight and struggle.</p>\n<p>College was the only way out of rural China. I needed to work very hard to graduate from elementary school, to be accepted into a middle and high school. I was a lone traveler on a narrow and precarious bridge above a deep valley, and while I was on it, I watched my friends and classmates fall one by one. Meanwhile, the road ahead of me became increasingly narrow. Should I have been happy or worried? Because of fierce competition, I was terrified that any misstep might drag me off course. Apart from studying, I was never able to have a hobby or partake in extra-curriculars, not that the school ever offered any opportunities. On the first day in high school, our principal told us that we had only one goal during those three years– <em>Gao Kao</em>.(college entrance exam) So, during that time, I woke up at 5:30 every morning, and went to bed at 11:00 PM. During holidays, I was memorizing test questions.</p>\n<p>For you, there is no question that you’ll graduate elementary school and go onward to middle and high school. The competition isn’t that fierce, and your homework load isn’t that heavy. You can take the time to develop a hobby, to read the books you want, to play basketball, to take excursions to the countryside to enjoy its blue skies. If you don’t want to work so hard for Gao Kao, and your grades aren’t atrocious, you can opt for a school who’s willing to recruit you without test scores. And even if your scores are indeed atrocious, a third tier university will still accept you. Meanwhile, I have to earn exceptionally high marks to get into that same third tier university, since universities demand more from out-of-state students.</p>\n<p>We take the same test. The minimum score requirements for you and me are not the same. But once we’re accepted, our tuition fees are again the same. Every person pays 6000RMB per year – that’s for tuition only, which comes out as 24,000 RMB for all four years. Housing (1500RMB), and books (1000RMB) add up to around 4000RMB – and I’m only talking about eating cafeteria food the entire time. Four years of college comes down to 50,000 RMB. In 2003, a university in Shanghai announced that it was raising its annual tuition to 10,000 RMB due to the “campus renovation” That means 40,000 RMB for four years of tuition alone. Count in living and text book costs and a university education adds up to 66,000 RMB. For families who live in the city, 66,000 RMB isn’t much. For a rural family, 66,000 RMB is a life time’s worth of savings. I come from a coastal province that has been getting steady foreign investment. We were better off compared to some inner provinces, but still, after a year of hard labor, we were hard pressed to save much. A family of four who consume only the very basics can save 3000 RMB each year. That means to send one child to a four year college at 66,000 RMB a family needs to save for 22 years. That’s assuming that no one gets sick. It also means that no matter how talented the second child is the family must still deprive him or her from attending college since they can only afford to send one.</p>\n<p>I was lucky compared to others. By throwing together all the funds we had, and by taking out student loans, I was finally able to pay my first year of tuition. Meanwhile, I watched those students who’d been accepted and the heartbreak their families experienced for being unable to send them to school. I felt a pervasive sense of wrongness. Our education industry nowadays don’t only recruit the best students, they recruit the students with the richest parents.</p>\n<p>But, finally I found myself on a University campus! I worked hard and earned a scholarship. During the holidays, I worked to save spending money. I couldn’t bear asking my parents for money. Every cent they made was an exchange of their sweat. That money was sweat money, blood money.</p>\n<p>Upon coming to Shanghai, I realized that compared to my classmates, I was green beyond belief. I couldn’t draw, couldn’t play an instrument, didn’t know who the hottest pop stars were, had never read a best selling novel, didn’t know what an MP3 was, didn’t even know what a Walkman was. To understand what our management professor was lecturing about during his class on “Warehouse style supermarkets” like Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club, I spent a day at “McDonalds” watching with astonishment. I’d never seen so much stuff.</p>\n<p>I’d never touched a computer, so I spent half a year sitting in a computer lab learning the skills you’d learned in high school. My English is the English spoken by a deaf or a mute person. Neither westerners nor Chinese people can understand what I’m saying. But that wasn’t my fault. There were never any foreign teachers in my village. When teachers don’t even know the language, how can they possibly teach students to speak? With a poor foundation, I spent an entire year correcting my pronunciation. I admired city students for how talented they were, how much they knew. I only knew how to study. I’d only known studying, test taking, graduating, because only by getting into college could I study amongst you and become a part of you. Everything had to be geared and pointed towards this goal.</p>\n<p>I could bear the mockery of my classmates, could go weeks without eating any meat, could spend my entire weekend cooped up in a library, could come back from studying on the weekend to see boys and girls dancing, could go running at the deep of the night out of loneliness and boredom. I dreamt that one day I would graduate, and find a job in the city. I wanted to work with the city-dwellers of my generation, and like them, to become a city resident. I wanted my parents to be proud because they had a son working in Shanghai!</p>\n<p>Finally, I graduated. Finding a job in Shanghai was hard, but going back to the village was not an option. The average salary for our class was 2000RMB per month. Perhaps you think that 2000RMB is an adequate salary, but I still needed to pay for rent, to pay for utilities, to pay back my student loans, and to send money home to put my brother and sister through school. What was left, I used for food. After all of this, I still couldn’t join you for a coffee at Starbucks!</p>\n<p>Since that time I’ve earned a master’s degree, and currently live in Shanghai where my annual salary is 80,000 RMB. I fought for eighteen years, and can finally sit down with you for a cup of coffee. I’m now a resident in this big, international city, and I’m no different from the white collar workers here. However, I can never forget the struggles my family and I went through. I can never forget my classmates who will never see their dreams come true. For this reason, I’ve written this in the first person. What I’ve written is nothing special. It’s the typical tale of those who come from rural China. Every time I see a student who’s been dealt same hand I got, I feel a heavy sense of responsibility.</p>\n<p>I didn’t write this to complain. The terrifying thing isn’t that justice is relative. The terrifying thing is to witness injustice and to act as if one sees nothing. While I was getting my masters, I once had a conversation with a girl who at the time had 3 years of work experience under her belt. She is now the HR director of a joint stock company. We were talking about a marketing strategy for Weida’s paper industry. Her idea was to carve out a new market by advertising Weida’s high quality dinner napkins to China’s nine hundred million farmers. Surprised by her cocksureness, I asked her if she knew how farmers wipe their mouths after each meal. She returned my question with a misgiving look. I raised my hand and wiped my mouth on my sleeve. She looked at my graceless action with contempt.</p>\n<p>During a macro-economics class, a classmate attacked blue collar workers who’d been laid off, and unemployed high school dropouts: “80% of them are where they are because they don’t work hard. They chose not to specialize in something when they were young, so they can’t get jobs now! Those kids are perfectly capable of studying and working. I’ve heard that a lot of students use their holidays to make thousands to pay their tuition.” You can’t find a person who knows less about the struggles of rural China than this classmate of mine.</p>\n<p>I was born during the 70s. People my age are starting to become leaders and our actions affect the social and economic development. I wrote this essay for the young people who grew up in well-heeled communities, and for those who grew up struggling but have since forgotten. Pay attention to the classes beneath you. For this world to be fairer, we need to do what we can for others, to be aware that social responsibility warrants a permanent place in our thoughts and actions.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?a=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?a=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?i=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?a=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?i=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?a=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?a=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?i=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?a=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?a=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:KwTdNBX3Jqk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?i=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:KwTdNBX3Jqk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?a=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?a=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?i=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?a=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Eff/ChinaHush?i=l9keIoECsiI:6_wLANsZ8iw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/ChinaHush/%7E4/l9keIoECsiI\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

Even if you have no clue what the Dropbox API does, chances are you’ve already used it — it’s the engine that powers our iPhone and Android apps and thousands of third-party Dropbox-enabled apps. This is our first major update since releasing the API, and we’re stoked to share the improvements we’ve made:</p>\n<p><strong>Increased security</strong><br>\nYou’ll never have to enter your Dropbox account info into a third-party app on version 1. Instead, you’ll approve access using the official Dropbox app on mobile or via the web at dropbox.com.</p>\n<p><strong>App folders</strong><br>\nVersion 1 adds support for apps that can only read or write to a single folder in your Dropbox. You can rename or move this App Folder wherever you want in your Dropbox, and the app will keep working normally.</p>\n<p><strong>Search, revisions, and more</strong><br>\nWe’ve added a lot of new calls to the API to make apps even more powerful. Developers can now build search and sharing right into their apps. Version 1 also exposes the full power of the Dropbox revision system. This includes undeleting files, reverting files to past versions, and not overwriting changes when two people update a file at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>More supported platforms</strong><br>\nVersion 0 of the API was designed for mobile apps. While they’re still getting plenty of love, we’ve now added better support for web apps! This includes new tutorials, documentation, and SDKs for Python, Ruby, and Java developers.</p>\n<p>Our new API is available to developers right now at <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/developers\">https://www.dropbox.com/developers</a>, so look forward to these features in your favorite Dropbox-enabled apps in the coming months!</p>"

The theory opened eyes and minds around the world to a radical new understanding of the flora and fauna of the planet. Here, Darwin showed for the first time that no supernatural processes are necessary to explain the profusion of living beings on earth, that all organisms past and present are related in a historical branching pattern of descent, and that human beings fall into place quite naturally in the web of all life. Now, 150 years later and 200 years after Darwins birth, we celebrate the amazingly productive vision and reach of his theory. In this Fall Quarter course, we will meet weekly with leading Darwin scholars from around the country to learn about Darwins far-reaching legacy in fields as diverse as anthropology, religion, medicine, psychology, philosophy, literature, and biology. With such a broad reach across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities, no wonder the theory of evolution by natural selection has been called the single best idea, ever.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/io9/2011/10/astrobio.jpg\" width=\"340\" alt=\"10 Awesome Online Classes You Can Take For Free\" title=\"10 Awesome Online Classes You Can Take For Free\"><strong>9.

This course begins with the evolution of behavior, the driver of nervous system evolution, reviewed using concepts developed in ethology, sociobiology, other comparative studies, and in studies of brain evolution. The roles of various types of plasticity are considered, as well as foraging and feeding, defensive and aggressive behavior, courtship and reproduction, migration and navigation, social activities and communication, with contributions of inherited patterns and cognitive abilities. Both field and laboratory based studies are reviewed; and finally, human behavior is considered within the context of primate studies.</p>\n<p><em>Top image via Kirsty Pargeter/Shutterstock; animalwallpapers.net; Reistlin Magere/Shutterstock<br>\nAstrobio image via <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/group/astrobiology/cgi-bin/\">Stanford's Astrobiology Webpage</a>; Observatory via holbox/Shutterstock; Cog Neuroscience <a href=\"http://noviespub.blogspot.com/2011/04/cognitive-neuroscience-and.html\">via</a>; animal behavior <a href=\"http://www.scienceclarified.com/As-Bi/Behavior.html\">via</a></em></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.gawker.com/~ff/io9/vip?a=mleWQ98B_Oo:LyqX322uRSo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/io9/vip?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.gawker.com/~ff/io9/vip?a=mleWQ98B_Oo:LyqX322uRSo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/io9/vip?i=mleWQ98B_Oo:LyqX322uRSo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.gawker.com/~ff/io9/vip?a=mleWQ98B_Oo:LyqX322uRSo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/io9/vip?i=mleWQ98B_Oo:LyqX322uRSo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.gawker.com/~ff/io9/vip?a=mleWQ98B_Oo:LyqX322uRSo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/io9/vip?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/io9/vip/~4/mleWQ98B_Oo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Twice a year, during the latter halves of March and September, every person on Earth experiences the effects of an equinox in the form of a 12-hour day followed by a 12-hour night.</p>\n<p>To observe this perfect division of light and dark over a 24-hour period here on Earth is one thing, but seeing it from 36,000 km up helps one appreciate, in an instant, the awesome symmetry of the event, as light from the Sun spreads evenly over our planet's Northern and Southern Hemispheres.</p>\n<p>The equinoxes are the only times of year when Earth's axis tilts perpendicular to the Sun's rays; in the weeks and months separating the equinoxes, Earth's axis will tilt progressively farther away from or toward the sun, exposing the Northern and Southern Hemispheres of the planet to varying degrees of sunlight in the process.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"lytebox\" href=\"http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/8/2011/09/explore_io9_videos_1779.jpg\"></a> The whole cycle — from last year&#39;s winter solstice, to today&#39;s fall equinox — is captured beautifully in the time-lapse video of Earth featured here. The video comprises images of Earth captured over the last 12 months by <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\">EUMETSTAT's</a> Meteosat-9, including the one pictured up top.</p>\n<p>You'll notice that the Earth does not appear to be rotating in the video. That's because the Meteosat-9 satellite is in what is called \"geostationary orbit\" around the Earth. The satellite is located directly above the equator, and is orbiting Earth at the exact same speed that the planet is rotating about its axis, such that the satellite does not move at all relative to Earth's surface.</p>\n<p>The video helps illustrate how the angle of the Earth's axis relative to the Sun affects the amount of sunlight each hemisphere receives (and, by extension, the changing of the seasons) throughout the year. According to the NASA Earth Observatory:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On March 20 and September 20 [at approximately 00:06 and 00:12, respectively], the terminator [where the shadows of nightfall meet the sunlight of dusk and dawn] is a straight north-south line, and the Sun is said to sit directly above the equator. On December 21 [at approximately 00:03], the Sun resides directly over the Tropic of Capricorn when viewed from the ground, and sunlight spreads over more of the Southern Hemisphere. On June 21 [at approximately 00:06], the Sun sits above the Tropic of Cancer, spreading more sunlight in the north and turning the tables on the south. The bulge of our spherical Earth blocks sunlight from the far hemisphere at the solstices; that same curvature allows the Sun's rays to spread over more area near the top and bottom of the globe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[Via <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\">NASA Earth Observatory</a>]<br>\n<em>Top image and video via NASA earth Observatory</em></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.gawker.com/~ff/io9/vip?a=heYB1GNKYP0:fxKjskAu2U8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/io9/vip?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.gawker.com/~ff/io9/vip?a=heYB1GNKYP0:fxKjskAu2U8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/io9/vip?i=heYB1GNKYP0:fxKjskAu2U8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.gawker.com/~ff/io9/vip?a=heYB1GNKYP0:fxKjskAu2U8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/io9/vip?i=heYB1GNKYP0:fxKjskAu2U8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.gawker.com/~ff/io9/vip?a=heYB1GNKYP0:fxKjskAu2U8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/io9/vip?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/io9/vip/~4/heYB1GNKYP0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<p><a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_S._Hart\">Michael Hart is dead.</a>  He was the founder of Project Gutenberg, and an incredible visionary for online books, and someone who touched my life.  I was in email contact with him from 1990, when I got my first access to the Internet and found Project Gutenberg.  I ran New Zealand mirror archives of Project Gutenberg texts, scanned and proofread books, and fell in with the write crowd, so to speak.</p>\n<p>I made a trip to the US around 1993 or 94.  It was a family trip to a bluegrass festival in Kentucky, but I asked Dad if we could tack on a few extra bits as we'd be \"close by\".  Those bits: a trip to Champagne-Illinois to meet Michael, and a trip to Rhode Island to meet a girl.  \"Close by\" if you're in NZ and looking at a map of the US and don't pay much attention to scale. Dad drove us to Rhode Island and I got to meet the girl, but he said I'd have to do my geek stuff by myself.</p>\n<p>So I flew into there somehow, and Michael picked me up and drove me around town. In Wellington, where I got my degree, the university sits on a hill above the town. In UIUC the town was built around the university! He showed me the divide between arts and science, made literal and laughable by the road that actually did divide the arts faculties on the left from science faculties on the right. We crossed the tracks, the actual tracks, to the bad side of town. He fed me American Pizza, and my clearest memory of the whole trip is watching him empty packets of sugar onto the top of his pizza.  Something like that really sticks in one's mind ....</p>\n<p>Then we went back to his house, which I believe he had inherited from his academic family.  In my memory it is huge, but I think that's principally because it was full of books. I remember him as loving physical books as much as he loved digital books, but most of all I remember him as generous with his time.  He took a lot of time out of his busy days to show this goober of a boy, 21 years old if that, around town.  He can't have got much back in conversational joy, as I wasn't a particularly worldly chap, and I didn't realize then what a lot of time I'd asked for and he'd given.  He put me up in his house, I made my way back to the family the next day, and when I eventually built a life for myself in America (not with the lass from Rhode Island, however) I often thought of Michael but never made the time to follow up. I regret it now.</p>\n<p>I learned a lot from Michael, though I don't think he realized it at the time. I learned how hard it is to be a pioneer: doing work that others don't value is thankless and marginalizing.  I learned how hard it is when others eventually follow you: they don't value what you've done nearly as much as they should, and they have lots of different ideas about the future than you do. I learned to be generous with my time. I learned that sugar on pizza is a taste it takes longer than one day to acquire.  And, most importantly, I learned that people can and do make a life for themselves doing what they love. </p>\n<p>RIP Michael.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=dmhWx4jkxCI:lMmBmJd9t-8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=dmhWx4jkxCI:lMmBmJd9t-8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=dmhWx4jkxCI:lMmBmJd9t-8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=dmhWx4jkxCI:lMmBmJd9t-8:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=dmhWx4jkxCI:lMmBmJd9t-8:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=dmhWx4jkxCI:lMmBmJd9t-8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=dmhWx4jkxCI:lMmBmJd9t-8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/dmhWx4jkxCI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

It’s hard to imagine life without it. How flat would a world be where  films have no scores, birthdays no ‘Happy Birthday,’ Christmas no  carols, gym workouts no playlist? Music is so ubiquitous and affects us  so deeply, so powerfully. But how much do we really know about it? How  well do we understand its emotional hold on our brains? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/my_playlists?p=C720D5DC4468B9B1\"><em>How Music Works</em></a>, a fascinating program from BBC4 (the same folks who brought us <a href=\"http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2010/09/27/horizon-the-end-of-god/\"><em>The End of God?: A Horizon Guide to Science and Religion</em></a>), explores just that.</p>\n<p>Composer <strong>Howard Goodall</strong> takes us on a journey into  music’s underbelly, examining the four basic elements that make it work:  Melody, rhythm, harmony and bass.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Melody is music’s most powerful tool when it comes to  touching our emotions. Our mothers sign lullabies to us when we’re  infants and tests have shown that we can even, as babies, recognize  tunes that we heard in he womb.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PnbOWi6f_IM\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Every music system in the world shares these five notes  in common. Indeed, they’re so fundamental to every note composed or  performed anywhere on the planet that it seems, like our instinct for  language, that they were pre-installed in us when we were born. These  five notes a human genetic inheritance, like the fingers on our hands.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Catch the four remaining parts of <em>Melody</em> here: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dalL5FpWR8&amp;feature=related\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrY_3_6fsjM&amp;feature=related\">3</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gp0WKrgqY&amp;feature=related\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPmnho7OvT8\">5</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/c_jEkNiYFNc\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Rhythm is the part of music that interacts most  immediately and spontaneously with our bodies. Without it, music would  be pleasant enough, but it would be brain food. With rhythm, though,  music becomes hypnotic and sensuous.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The rest of <em>Rhythm</em> here: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnhmEfwxEIM\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv8a8mdY8iQ\">3</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzRGH-5yk-w\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwig-fJ1t8Q\">5</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/hTUXKWnHH-g\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Unlike rhythm and melody, harmony wasn’t part of music  from the beginning. It’s an upstart. It came into life gradually during  the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. But what an upstart!”</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Harmony</em> continues here: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oShLg8JCHCg\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ik4Qt3MUw\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gTR_Lg59Jc\">5</a>.

It’s awesome: Bottom C. It’s big, it’s deep and it’s  powerful. And it came to stand in our minds for a sense of menace, or  wonder, or infinity. Just this one note. But there are loads of examples  of bass lines that give a piece of music its style and its shape.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The rest of <em>Bass</em> can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVhQJZuFUOA\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhBHnuiDCBk\">3</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKtAXHphNfM\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW_9T25Wgvg\">5</a>.</p>\n<p>For an even more fascinating look at the DNA of music, we highly recommend Goodall’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017HEY98?tag=braipick-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B0017HEY98&amp;adid=1E9EW5KZPZPRWBWK0SQP&amp;\"><em>Big Bangs</em></a>,  which explores the history of five epic discoveries — notation, equal  temperament, opera, the piano and recorded sound — that forever changed  the course of Western music.</p>\n<p><em>Source:</em><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2010/12/09/how-music-works/\">How Music Works</a><br>\nBrain Pickings, by Maria Popova</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/b0bjd6fho47voudd2of6s5dq9g/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ritholtz.com%2Fblog%2F2011%2F09%2Fhow-music-works%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:KwTdNBX3Jqk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:KwTdNBX3Jqk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=9T-vUghUCDc:NjSMFVi3H5M:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheBigPicture/~4/9T-vUghUCDc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<i>From time to time we invite guests to post about items of interest and are thrilled to have Brian May join us to talk about friend and bandmate Freddie Mercury. </i><i>Our doodle celebrating Freddie's birthday can be seen around the world on September 5 and, out of respect for Labor Day, in the U.S. on September 6.</i><i> A guitarist and songwriter, Brian May is a founding member of Queen and wrote many of the band’s hits, including “We Will Rock You,” “The Show Must Go On” and “I Want It All.” Brian is also a respected solo artist and one of the founders of Freddie for a Day (<a href=\"http://www.freddieforaday.com/\">www.freddieforaday.com</a>), an organization helping to fight HIV/AIDS globally. - Ed.</i><br>\n<br>\nI was first introduced to Freddie Mercury—a paradoxically shy yet flamboyant young man—at the side of the stage at one of our early gigs as the group “SMILE.”   He told me he was excited by how we played, he had some ideas—and he could sing! I'm not sure we took him very seriously, but he did have the air of someone who knew he was right. He was a frail but energised dandy, with seemingly impossible dreams and a wicked twinkle in his eye. A while later we had the opportunity to actually see him sing ... and it was scary! He was wild and untutored, but massively charismatic. Soon, he began his evolution into a world-class vocal talent, right in front of our eyes.<br>\n<br>\nFreddie was fully focused, never allowing anything or anyone to get in the way of his vision for the future. He was truly a free spirit.  There are not many of these in the world.  To achieve this, you have to be, like Freddie, fearless—unafraid of upsetting anyone's apple cart.<br>\n<br>\nSome people imagine Freddie as the fiery, difficult diva who required everyone around him to compromise. No. In our world, as four artists attempting to paint on the same canvas, Freddie was always the one who could find the compromise—the way to pull it through. If he found himself at odds with any one of us, he would quickly dispel the cloud with a generous gesture, a wisecrack or an impromptu present.  I remember one morning after a particularly tense discussion he presented me with a cassette.  He had been up most of the night compiling a collage of my guitar solos. \"I wanted you to hear them as I hear them, dear,\" he said. \"They're all fab, so I made them into a symphony!\"<br>\n<br>\nTo create with Freddie was always stimulating to the max. He was daring, always sensing a way to get outside the box.  Sometimes he was <i>too</i> far out ... and he'd usually be the first to realise it. With a conspiratorial smile he would say \"Oh ... did I lose it, dears?!\" But usually there was sense in his nonsense—art in his madness. It was liberating.  I think he encouraged us all in his way, to believe in our own madness, and the collective mad power of the group Queen.<br>\n<br>\nFreddie would have been 65 this year, and even though physically he is not here, his presence seems more potent than ever. Freddie made the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected. He gave people proof that a man could achieve his dreams—made them feel that through him they were overcoming their own shyness, and becoming the powerful figure of their ambitions. And he lived life to the full.  He devoured life.  He celebrated every minute. And, like a great comet, he left a luminous trail which will sparkle for many a generation to come.  <br>\n<br>\nHappy birthday Freddie!<br>\n<br>\n<span>Posted by Dr. Brian May, CBE.

Crumple it. Before you sink a three-pointer in the corner wastebasket, consider that you’ve just created an object of extraordinary mathematical and structural complexity, filled with mysteries that physicists are just starting to unfold. </p>\n<p>“Crush a piece of typing paper into the size of a golf ball, and suddenly it becomes a very stiff object. The thing to realize is that it’s 90 percent air, and it’s not that you designed architectural motifs to make it stiff. It did it itself,” said physicist Narayan Menon of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “It became a rigid object. This is what we are trying to figure out: What is the architecture inside that creates this stiffness?”</p>\n<p>Menon’s expedition into the shadowy heart of a crumpled sheet — of aluminum foil, to be precise — was undertaken with fellow Amherst physicist Anne Dominique Cambou and published in an August 23 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> article. The pair think they’ve mapped the mathematical underpinnings of its rigidity. </p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p><div style=\"width:410px\"><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2011/08/conical_crumple.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2011/08/conical_crumple.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"conical_crumple\" width=\"400\" height=\"402\"></a><p>The geometry of a conically distorted sheet of paper, painted and viewed through cross-polarized lenses that reveal subtle variations in wavelengths of reflected light. <em>Cerda et al./Nature.</em></p></div>Of course, it may seem surprising that a balled-up sheet of paper or foil should contort itself beyond knowledge. But Menon noted that when physicists finally <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v401/n6748/abs/401046a0.html\">described the precise dynamics of conical crumpling</a>, which you can achieve by laying a sheet of paper over a coffee cup and poking down with one finger,  it was regarded as a mathematical tour-de-force.</p>\n<p>A crumpled cone is a far simpler example of the tendencies that produce a crumpled ball: when a flat plane is subjected to distortional stress but only permitted to bend, not stretch, it transforms suddenly and unpredictably into a landscape of folds and facets, each representing an entirely new surface. It’s what researchers call a “far from equilibrium” process, guided by strange rules and non-linear effects. The mechanics of an individual crease are understood, but when physicists try to predict where that crease will appear or how it will influence the next, understanding goes dim. </p>\n<p>Trying to peer inside a crumpled ball by <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v8/n1/full/nmat2343.html\">simulating the process in three dimensions</a> is “mathematically nasty,” a problem that quickly pushes lab-grade computers to their limits, said Menon. And trying to reverse-engineer structure from patterns revealed upon unfolding just isn’t possible. What happens in a crumpled ball stays in a crumpled ball. </p>\n<div>‘I love it that these simple-looking problems are so nasty sometimes.’</div>\n<p>“If you’re not talking about simulation, but mathematical <em>understanding</em> of these things, that’s one step harder,” said Menon. “We understand the underlying equations of the mechanics of a thin sheet very well. Those have been around for a century. But solving those equations, to produce a physical understanding, is difficult even in simple cases. If you’re talking about a structure that owes its properties to 1,000 or more of these structures, interacting in complicated ways, that’s asking more than we can do now.” </p>\n<p>To look into crumpled balls, Menon and Cambou used <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/X-ray_microtomography\">X-ray microtomography</a>, an imaging technique that, like a medical <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ct-scan/MY00309\">CT scan</a>, assembles three-dimensional images from thousands of two-dimensional, cross-section snapshots. They imaged dozens of balls of different sizes, searching for statistical patterns in their internal geometries.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width:410px\"><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2011/08/crumpled_simulation.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2011/08/crumpled_simulation.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"crumpled_simulation\" width=\"400\" height=\"396\"></a><p>Internal snapshot of a simulated crumpled plastic sheet. <em>Tallinen et al./Nature</em></p></div>They found that a crumpled ball is most dense in its outer regions, and least dense in its core. Once inside its folds, there’s no way of knowing from their shape which direction is out and which is in (as, for example, one can determine from an onion, which has layers of skin arranged in curves parallel to its outer surface.) “If I was a creature that lived inside this ball, could I make my way out by looking at the way things are arranged? The answer is no,” said Menon. </p>\n<p>When he and Cambou studied arrangements of creases and folds, they found a distinctive pattern. Planes often lie flat against other planes. “It’s a fairly uniform object, though you’ve created it by a random, not-so-uniform process,” said Menon. “That’s the most surprising thing. There is no real geometrical reason why things should stack and layer in that way.” But if the researchers don’t know why this happens, they can speculate as to its effect: strength. </p>\n<p>Multiple layers of a thin sheet soon become walls. Per the lack-of-orientation observation, these walls are aligned in thousands of random directions. Press down and, from any angle, you’re pressing against down columns. “It can resist being crushed in all different directions,” said Menon. </p>\n<p>To explore why this happens, he and Cambou are now using transparent plastic sheets to make three-dimensional movies of crumpling. The implications extend far beyond Menon’s lab. “You’ve heard of crumple zones,” he said. “I’m just as interested in understanding leaves, or thin membranes of animal tissue, or the conformation of the Earth’s crust when it’s folded into mountains.

By that time Henson had long since divorced the wife and mother of his children, bought out her half of his company, and taken up with model types like Daryl Hannah. (A friend said, \"He loved beautiful things and beautiful women.\") Henson, under the care of his Christian scientist mother, refused medical treatment until it was too late. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered outside his ranch in Santa Fe.</p>\n<p>On September 26th, <em>Sesame Street</em> begins its 42nd season. It was the project that changed Jim Henson's life.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/sitllhanrf.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1306716416306\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p>The original idea for <em>Sesame Street</em> was the brainchild of television executive Joan Ganz Cooney. Considered the mother of all children's television, Cooney's decision to use Henson's puppets changed what would become <em>Sesame Street</em> from a somewhat dour educational program to an entertainment show. Up until then, the absolute pinnacle of children's television was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Kangaroo\">Bob Keeshan's <em>Captain Kangaroo</em></a>, and its rote instruction and low production values hardly comprised a breakthrough in the genre.</p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/hangonvevvvv.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1313683320966\" alt=\"\"></span><span style=\"width:530px\">Jim and his wife Jane with the puppets of Sam and Friends</span></span></p>\n<p>Henson's first attempt at children's television, <em>Sam and Friends</em>, was a dry run for his full cast of Muppets. The show's purpose was as much to hawk various products to the Washington D.C. area where it aired as to educate and entertain its audience. After the show signed off in 1961, the Muppets were already famous from Jack Paar's <em>The Tonight Show</em> and had appeared in a variety of commercials.</p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/thismorningentry.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1313675151075\" alt=\"\"></span></span></p>\n<p>Henson and company wanted to shoot a Muppet <em>Snow White </em>as a pilot for CBS, but when ABC showed more interest, they demanded a different fairy-tale heroine. Jim's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-gG9o482sI\">version of <em>Cinderella</em> </a>would air years after <em>Sesame Street</em> was on the air, but it was actually a test-run for the show. The reason that it did not air was half ABC getting college football and half the fact that it wasn't very funny.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/eminenmmm.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1306716571013\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p>There was little movement to create educational television until Lyndon Johnson began pushing for noncommercial television as part of his Great Society program. Despite powerful people in the Ford Foundation and Carnegie Corporation supporting the effort, all the major television networks passed on <em>Sesame Street</em>. Their fear, and eventually the fear of executives in public broadcasting, was that kids would just flip to cartoons instead of educational programming.</p>\n<p>Academics involved with <em>Sesame Street</em> developed papers on how to integrate the educational aspects of the show with the entertainment ones. Focus groups were essential in their approach; it was how they could tell if the children were actually learning. The attitude of the male academics towards Joan Ganz Cooney was also problematic <span>—</span> they undercut her when they could, informing whoever was listening that they did not know if a woman could command such a program, questioning whether a woman from a non-academic background could really handle such an enterprise. The education and research director from the Ford Foundation, Marjorie  Martus, opined that she \"did not think a project headed by a woman could  be taken seriously.\"</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/an%20early%20shoot.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1306716034099\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p>Despite these challenges, Cooney became the head of the Children's Television Workshop. A gruesome meeting of academics and creative types looking to siphon money from the show's appreciably large budget showed up to brainstorm ideas for the show. Maurice Sendak spent most of the time drawing pornographic cartoons of the participants. When a bearded, hippie-ish gentleman strolled into the back after they broke for lunch, Cooney initially thought he was a terrorist member of the Weathermen. Jim Henson introduced himself.</p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/sesame%20street%20555.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1313679227944\" alt=\"\"></span></span></p>\n<p>The first concepts for the visual look of <em>Sesame Street</em> involved an actual street with  the familiar trashcans redolent of a poverty-stricken neighborhood. It  was either too close to reality for a test audience of pre-schoolers, or  too far from it. They kept the setting but used a brownstone instead.</p>\n<p>The first title of <em>Sesame Street </em>was <em>123 Avenue B</em>. Setting the show itself in a place much of its audience had never experienced was radical enough; but immersing it on a drug-ridden street corner betrayed the naivete of all involved. A child under the supervision of a CTW consultant at a daycare center on the West Side came up with the name <em>Sesame Street</em>, and at the last minute, it was used. As recalled in Michael Davis' marvelous history of the show, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Street-Gang-Complete-History-Sesame/dp/0670019968\"><em>Street Gang</em></a>, feedback came back from the affliated advertising agency: \"Nobody is going to remember it. It has too many esses.\"</p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/hack_black.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1313685283051\" alt=\"\"></span><span style=\"width:530px\">Jim was bored and painted a plumber's closet while waiting to go on The Tonight Show.</span></span></p>\n<p>Once production began, the creative elements took over the show. The writers and actors drank constantly after-hours, fleshing out ideas for the next day. Henson worked harder than anyone, using entire weekends to film sequences.</p>\n<p>Bert and Ernie, performed by Frank Oz and Henson respectively, became the show's centerpiece. Rather than <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/bert-and-ernie-should-come-out-of-sesame-streets-closet-20110818-1j01e.html\">a relationship between two homosexuals</a>, the connection actually paralleled Frank and Jim's real life interactions, with Jim as the troublemaker egging on the more mercurial Oz. Another Frank puppet, Grover, represented a different direction from the same Bert and became one of the show's biggest attractions.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"530\" height=\"385\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/WkPh8As-y6E\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The first test screenings scored high marks for the puppets, but the long-mulled over choices for live actors were not as appealing, and passages featuring human actors generally bored the kids.</p>\n<p>Encouraged by the early reaction, the academics began to see the potential in Henson's puppets. A Harvard professor suggested a fumbling figure who could make mistakes, and Henson created Big Bird to soften the proceedings, a  puppet that stood over eight feet tall and required the puppeteer to enter  it. Henson's  walk wasn't birdlike enough so the part went to Henson recruit and talented puppeteer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroll_Spinney\">Caroll  Spinney</a>.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/walkingtherddddd.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1306716963967\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p>In the first episode, Bert and Ernie set up their traditional interplay:</p>\n<p><strong>ERNIE:</strong> Hey, Bert. Can I have a bar of soap?</p>\n<p><strong>BERT:</strong> Yah.</p>\n<p><strong>ERNIE:</strong> Just toss it into Rosie here.</p>\n<p><strong>BERT:</strong> Who's Rosie?</p>\n<p><strong>ERNIE:</strong> My bathtub. I call my bathtub Rosie.</p>\n<p><strong>BERT:</strong> Ernie, why do you call your bathtub Rosie?</p>\n<p><strong>ERNIE:</strong> What's that?</p>\n<p><strong>BERT:</strong> I said, why do you call your bathtub Rosie?</p>\n<p><strong>ERNIE:</strong> Because every time I take a bath I leave a ring around Rosie.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/watching%20a%20playback.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1306717233487\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p>Henson had set up shop at East 67th Street, living with his growing family in a place that could occupy both of his major creative projects.  The first Henson workshop constituted a space where ideas arose  constantly and could be encouraged. Characters like Oscar the Grouch,  Prairie Dawn and Aloysius Snuffleupagus emerged out of this  collaborative environment, and soon there was a menagerie of potential  puppets for the show that far exceeded the cast of <em>Sam and Friends.</em></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/lyingdown%20on%20the%20ojb.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1306717423204\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p>To a child watching <em>Sesame Street</em> for the first time on November 10th, 1969, it must have been something of a shock to the system. The inner-city setting integrated with a range of somewhat frighteningly realistic animal characters was fortunately softened by Henson's short films, where he really showed off his ability to captivate children with his perspective.</p>\n<p>From the moment it aired, <em>Sesame Street </em>was a tremendous success among its core audience of children and parents, as well as the television executives who the show depended on for its continued existence. Children's television had never done ratings like this; parents immediately saw the utility of using the show to watch their kids.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/the%20absent.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1306717517699\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p><em>Time</em> touted the show as \"one of the best researched programs in history\" and gave credit to the combination of public and private enterprise. In reality, it was largely Henson's creative genius that made the show such a phenomenon, but that did not stop reams of educators and academics from beaming with pride. <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,840386,00.html\"><em>Time </em>wrote</a>,</p>\n<p><em>This week the National Educational Television network began to do  something for that forgotten minority with the first segment of </em>Sesame  Street<em>. A color series to run one hour every weekday for the next 6½  months, </em>Sesame<em>'s 130 segments are dedicated to the proposition that  children are people, involved in their own quest for enlightenment and  entertainment via the video set.</em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>What </em>Sesame Street<em> does, blatantly and unashamedly,  is take full advantage of what children like best about TV. &quot;Face  it — kids love commercials,&quot; explains Joan Ganz Cooney, executive  director of NET&#39;s Children&#39;s Television Workshop. &quot;Their visual impact  is way ahead of everything else seen on television; they are clever,  and they tell a simple, self-contained story.&quot; <br></em></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/hertbitrhtht.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1306717584473\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p>The show won every honor possible for children's television, and President Nixon wrote to Joan Ganz Cooney, telling her that \"the many children and families now benefitting from <em>Sesame Street</em> are participants in one of the most promising experiments in the history of that medium. The Children's Television Workshop certainly deserves the high praise it has been getting from young and old alike in every corner of the nation. This administration is enthusiastically committed to opening up opportunities for every youngster, particularly during his first five years of life, and is pleased to be among the sponsors of your distinguished program.\"</p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/scotttmcjewy.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1313678793972\" alt=\"\"></span></span></p>\n<p>Of course, there was backlash. Some educators resented having to share their job with a television program they felt was beneath them, and academics were still skeptical that a television program could be good for young ones.</p>\n<p>The chief complaint about <em>Sesame Street</em> was the very thing that had captivated the attention of its target audience: the show's breakneck pace. It was impossible to be bored watching <em>Sesame Street</em>: if you did not like one particular segment, another was on its way. Taking its cues from the theater, including the considerable influence of vaudeville, <em>Sesame Street</em> endeavored never to be boring. To some, that was what made it dangerous to traditional learning <span>—</span> how could the classroom compare to an expensive television production?</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"530\" height=\"385\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ww3RAgnVOIs\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Mississippi banned the show because of its integrated cast, and the National Organization for Women tore into the show for its depiction of Susan the homemaker, complaining that \"the program has shown greater responsiveness to the needs of blacks than women.\" The Hispanic community was even more incensed <span>—</span> in the early years of the show, they had no representative on <em>Sesame Street.</em></p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/astillhangoneveryword.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1313679987363\" alt=\"\"></span></span></p>\n<p>With the commercial success of <em>Sesame Street</em>, advertisers and toy companies wanted to cash in.  Henson was extremely resistant to marketing the characters he had  created, but once Cooney convinced him it would make his company  financially profitable and therefore independent, he relented.</p>\n<p>To fill the show's need for new characters and Henson's need for marketable muppets, more performers and writers were brought aboard. <em>Sesame Street</em>'s then-head writer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Stiles\">Norman Stiles</a> came up with Count von Count, a dylslexic Dracula who poked gentle fun at Bela Lugosi. Writer/director <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stone\">Jon Stone</a> and Henson reworked an old design into the fabulously popular Cookie Monster, originally created for an ad campaign. Producer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Robinson_%28actor%29\">Matt Robinson</a> created a Roosevelt Franklin puppet that spoke in scat and was identifiably African-American. Black executives within the CTW were horrified, and the character was \"killed off.\" In 1985, a little-used Muppet named Elmo became the show's mainstay.</p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/oz%20and%20kermit.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1313681163929\" alt=\"\"></span></span></p>\n<p>By the time <em>Sesame Street</em> grew into itself, Henson already felt trapped. His ambitions lurked outside of children's television and had inspired <a href=\"http://blog.moviefone.com/2009/10/01/watch-this-jim-hensons-time-piece/\">his classic short <em>Time Piece</em></a> among other more adult-oriented projects. He did not want to work on <em>Sesame Street</em> for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>Cooney told him, \"You are going to break out of this. Something is going to happen that will provide new opportunities for you. You need to have the patience and belief to see what I'm saying is true.\" Other projects, including the groundbreaking <em>Muppet Show</em> and several feature films lay in Jim's future, and Joan was right: all became possible because of what he had done for children.</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://thisrecording.com/storage/perfect%20artttenda.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1306717737684\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p>His funeral is bizarre, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvy36-18gqk\">even now</a>. The notice in <em>The New York Times</em> read:</p>\n<p><em>A memorial service for the puppeteer Jim Henson, who created Kermit the  Frog and many other Muppet creatures, is to be held at noon on Monday at  the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th  Street. Written instructions left by Mr. Henson, who died of a bacterial  infection at 53 years of age on Wednesday, requested that no one  attending wear black.</em></p>\n<p>CNN wanted to broadcast the services live, but the family would not  allow it. Employees of the company distributed fabric butterflies on  wands to the attendees. His children and his ex-wife aimed for something uplifting more than  maudlin.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"530\" height=\"385\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/zguccnOjnOI\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The end result is a moving synthesis of both extremes.

It simply takes a little more thought.</p>\n<p>Too many men make the mistake of believing they can buy their way out of thinking. But creative, cheap dates are often the best kind. They’re more memorable than the standard dinner and a movie, and when a woman sees that you’re thoughtful, she won’t care how much dough you spent on taking her out (if she’s a keeper, that is).</p>\n<p>So here are 10 fiscally responsible options for when you’re short on cash but still want to impress her with a terrific date…</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Wine Tasting</strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"wine\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/07/wine.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"404\" height=\"250\"></p>\n<p>Wineries are sprouting up everywhere this side of Antarctica. Most of these upstarts allow wine tasting for free or for a very small price (and often times, those that charge let you keep the glass.) Go and learn about the different wines, what they pair well with, and keep mental notes on which varietals she enjoys the most. Knowing a woman’s preferred type of wine isn’t as important as knowing her eye color, but it helps. As counter-intuitive as it may feel for those of us who see wasting alcohol as a mortal sin, make sure you use that spit bucket. You’re driving, you need to be responsible, and if you swallow every taste you’re not going to be fit to drive her home. You don’t have to spit every taste, but showcase some restraint. She’ll notice and appreciate it.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Hit a Flea Market</strong></h3>\n<p>Unlike antique shops, flea markets seem geared for the young and not as affluent. The merchandise is almost always more interesting if not downright weird. Same goes for the people in attendance and those who are selling the goods. You can watch people barter, look over pieces of furniture that are probably haunted, and maybe pick up some small gift for your date if something inexpensive catches her eye. If it’s jewelery? Who knows. Maybe it won’t even turn her skin green. (Or it could end up being some awesome treasure). Try and stick to outdoor flea markets that have a good reputation. Not those once in a blue moon indoor sales which charge you an arm and a leg before you even get to lay eyes on what’s for sale.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. The Sunset Hike + Post Pub Visit</strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"couplehiking_d\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/07/couplehiking_d.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"299\" height=\"348\"></p>\n<p>Going for a meandering walk with no real destination can be fun, but hiking to the top of an easy to get to peak to watch the sun go down gives you purpose. Keep it to under 45 minutes. You don’t want to go on some epic journey only to end up stumbling through the dark. Reward yourselves with a beer or glass of wine afterwards at a cozy pub. This works terrific in the fall when you can see all the changing leaves around you.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. The Photography-Filled Afternoon</strong></h3>\n<p>File this one under the category of two-birds/one stone. Most of us have relatives in other parts of the country (or world) and you never know what to get them for their birthday or the holidays. Go on a photo hunting expedition in your hometown for the places and scenes that best represent where you live. When you’re all done, pick 12 of the best and hit one of the many websites that allow you to upload photos and create wall calendars. There’s your gift for Grandma and Grandpa who live a few time zones away and would love a reminder of what it looks like where you live.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. The Bicycle Picnic</strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"bike\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/07/bike.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"372\" height=\"429\"></p>\n<p>Picnics are always at the top of everyone’s list for cheap and romantic dates. But mixing in a leisurely long bike ride can make a nice difference. It’s relaxing, you get to enjoy some scenery on the way, and it’s far more romantic and engaging when compared to fighting through traffic and finding a place to park. Keep the menu simple, know any open container laws that might apply to your eventual picnic destination, and make sure you’ve got a backpack and bike gear rack that can handle your load. Take a bike lock with you. You might end up taking a detour on the way home for ice cream.</p>\n<h3><strong>6. Take a Historical Walking Tour of Your Town</strong></h3>\n<p>Almost always free, historical walking tours actually make you stop and appreciate the history that most of us drive by every single day. We’ve got our own point As and point Bs, and most of us rarely spend time focusing on the places in-between. Usually these tours are led by volunteers who can be real characters, and the buildings and their stories are never boring. Both (the guides and history) will provide for plenty of conversation at the cafe or bar afterward. Nostalgia, history, architecture, an appreciation for the past… it’s all wrapped up in one of these on-foot freebies.</p>\n<h3><strong>7. Cheering on Your Local Roller Derby Girls</strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"roller\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/07/roller.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"417\" height=\"328\"></p>\n<p>For the cost of one cheap seat at most major league games, you and your date could watch one of the hundreds of local roller derby clubs duke it out with a rival. Usually a ticket will let you see a couple of bouts, and the speed and spills are the real deal. It’s something different but still sports related, with just enough adrenaline, which doesn’t involve sweaty guys for once.</p>\n<h3><strong>8. The Untraditional Movie Night</strong></h3>\n<p>There are two options here. First, if you’ve just jumped into a relationship, skip the new romantic comedy that just hit the Redbox, and instead go with a classic like <em>Casablanca</em>, <em>To Catch a Thief</em>, or even the goofy-as-all-get-out original <em>Ocean’s 11</em>. Grab some takeout, make a meal, or <a title=\"5 Classic Cocktails Every Man Should Know\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/01/5-classic-cocktails-every-man-should-know/\">have some cocktails</a> on hand that line up with the plot or location of your chosen old Hollywood story. Set an upscale mood by dressing up a bit. You don’t want to look like you’re settling in for a night on the couch because you have the flu. Just because you’re at home watching a movie, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t dress up for her.</p>\n<p>For those that have been in a relationship for awhile, consider reenacting your first movie date. We all (should) know the first movie we saw with our significant other. Find it for cheap on DVD, grab a wicker type basket from a craft store, dress it up with some tissue paper, and load it up with popcorn, M&amp;Ms, and other movie theater-type snacks. Deliver it to her and ask her over for a movie night. Should cost you less than the arm and a leg you spent on just the popcorn and sodas alone when you two first saw it in the theater.</p>\n<h3><strong>9. Farmer’s Market in the Morning, Making Dinner Together That Evening</strong></h3>\n<p>Staying in and <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/03/18/the-10-commandments-of-the-at-home-dinner-date/\">making dinner together</a> is as romantic as it gets, but use your dinner date as an excuse to hit your local farmer’s market that morning. Stroll past the different vendors, and eventually you’ll start assembling a pile of fresh local ingredients that you can use that evening. You don’t have to get everything at the market. Maybe just the foundational items for each course–perhaps a couple bunches of kale to saute up with some olive oil and garlic, a couple of local organic chicken breasts that will be plenty easy to stuff, and some berries to pair up with shortcake for dessert. Get creative, then use the middle of the day to find some easy recipes and pick up the rest of the ingredients you’ll need.</p>\n<h3><strong>10. Monopoly. Loser Buys Dinner or Drinks</strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"cards2\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2011/07/cards2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"307\"></p>\n<p>Don’t scoff at board games (or cards). They can make for a terrific evening in (if that’s what you’re looking for). Put a friendly couples related wager down on the outcome (dinner, drinks… I’m sure your imagination is wandering to other places). It’ll make the game all the more interesting. Skip Scrabble or Trivial Pursuit. Those can get too mentally competitive. Monopoly has enough chance involved that no one’s feelings will get hurt (yours included) if someone completely dominates the other. And dominate Monopoly you will if you nab those orange properties (it’s true, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/294260.stm\">they’ve done studies</a>). Win, and if the prize includes a night out on her dime? Then this cheap date idea just produced another. Well… for you at least.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What are your favorite cheap date ideas?

Here Is How To Make It Even Better\"></a></p><p>Do you love <a href=\"http://getapp.cc/app/324684580\">Spotify</a>? <a href=\"http://appadvice.com/appnn/2011/08/spotify-has-1-4-million-u-s-customers-so-far\">Almost one and half a million Americans do</a>. Yet, do you know that on top of being a better version of iTunes, Spotify is also an amazing music social platform? Using playlists, some great websites and even Facebook, you can make Spotify even better than it already is. Here is what you need to know:</p>\n<p>One of the key features of Spotify is the playlists. Situated at the bottom left of the desktop app, and as the first tab of the iOS app, they’re simply compilations of songs you like. You probably have noticed that you can create those playlists, and have them synced with your iDevice. You can even flip a switch and have them downloaded to enable listening offline. This can become really powerful because the playlists don’t need to stay private. You can share them, and in turn, see what others are listening to.</p>\n<p>The first way to do this is through Facebook, and you can simply activate that in the file menu. Your friends that use Spotify will then appear in a right tab called “Friends,” and selecting them will grant you access to their published playlists. As for your lists, you can select which ones are polished enough to be made available to others by right clicking them and selecting “publish.”</p>\n<p>What’s interesting is that you don’t have to keep going back there to access their lists. By hitting +subscribe, you’re signing yourself up for this person’s playlist, and it will be added to your own playlists. Then, if they update it, their changes will reflect on your copy as well.</p>\n<p>So what if your friends have horrible indie tastes and only listen to depressing songs? That’s when the power of Spotify shows its full potential. There are <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ct5l29\">some wonderful websites/services</a> that let you share and access playlists. One of the best ones, <a href=\"http://sharemyplaylists.com\">sharemyplaylists.com</a>, features almost 50,000 user generated playlists, which are ranked weekly and have enough range to cover any taste. You can access these right from your desktop or iOS (the interface isn’t optimal, but it works). You can browse and search for playlists, and by hitting play, it will launch Spotify and let you listen to all the songs it contains. If you like what you’re hearing, you can subscribe. The lists vary in how dynamic they are. For example, you could just go for a static <a href=\"http://sharemyplaylists.com/rolling-stone-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time\">Rolling Stone Magazine 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time</a>, or <a href=\"http://sharemyplaylists.com/weeklytop50tracks\">the continually updated week’s top 50.</a></p>\n<p>Another cool tip is that you can actually add anybody you want as a friend, even without Facebook, as long as you have their username. To access their profile, simply enter spotify:user:username in the search field. For example, to follow me you could type spotify:user:xonderx, but I wouldn’t recommend it.</p>\n<p>That’s it for our Spotify tips and tricks. Did we miss anything?

Called the “Steady,” it has a familiar Leatherman-like design, only it adds a couple of tripod legs and a threaded bolt to the pliers-shaped package.</p>\n<p>The Steady won’t launch until 2012, so we don’t have further details of the full twelve-tool lineup inside, but you have to think it’ll be the usual collection of screwdrivers and blades. The point of this, though, is the addition of two flip-out legs that — in combination with the main body and the tripod bush on the other side — turn it into a miniature tripod. They’re like the detachable plastic tire-levers found on many bicycle multitools. Only not detachable (they probably could be used to take a tire off, though).</p>\n<p>Standalone minipods are tiny and light enough as it is, but if you’re carry a multitool anyway, why not make it this one? The estimated price is $65, available, as mentioned, sometime next year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gerberuk.com/index.php/products/tools\">Gerber Tools main page</a> [Gerber UK via <a href=\"http://gearjunkie.com/gerber-multitool-camera-tripod\">Gear Junkie</a>]</p>\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/06/eatensil-a-multi-tool-for-takeout-food/\">Eatensil, A Multi-Tool for Takeout Food</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/05/nerdy-necklace-is-really-a-multitool/\">Nerdy Necklace Is Really a Multitool</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/11/2000-year-old-roman-multi-tool/\">1800-Year-Old Roman Multitool</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/08/46567/\">German Multi-Tool Pen Engineered to Outlast its Owner</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/fd41fsiu2u7jqfcjk2jnp524eg/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fgadgetlab%2F2011%2F07%2Fsteady-shot-photographers-multitool-with-tripod%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.wired.com/~ff/GearFactor?a=M_KnLyqp3QU:tuq50RpPG8E:cGdyc7Q-1BI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GearFactor?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wired.com/~ff/GearFactor?a=M_KnLyqp3QU:tuq50RpPG8E:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GearFactor?i=M_KnLyqp3QU:tuq50RpPG8E:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wired.com/~ff/GearFactor?a=M_KnLyqp3QU:tuq50RpPG8E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GearFactor?i=M_KnLyqp3QU:tuq50RpPG8E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wired.com/~ff/GearFactor?a=M_KnLyqp3QU:tuq50RpPG8E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GearFactor?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GearFactor/~4/M_KnLyqp3QU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<p>To prepare for an upcoming <a href=\"http://2011.dconstruct.org/conference/frank-chimero\">lecture</a>, I’ve been thinking about the relationship between collecting and curating. This morning, I tweeted:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Thinking about collecting vs. curating, and how the internet is muddying the line between the two.</blockquote>\n\n<p>I didn’t realize it at the time, but it seems I hit something unexpected with that tweet. I received many responses from folks telling me what they thought the line between the two were. The gist for most is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Collection is additive. Curation is subtractive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Collecting is for yourself, curating is for others.</blockquote>\n\n<p>The size of the group of things and the presence of an audience are the two characteristics that are used as touchstones. Those seem to be the right things to discuss, but the internet makes them trickier to pin down.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, I would consider my Pinboard account a collection of links, but it has an audience because it is public. Is it still a collection?</p>\n\n<p>Or, many of the blogs that people say are curated are usually a group of beautiful images rolling down a webpage. What distinguishes that from my Pinboard page of links?</p>\n\n<p>See? Messy!</p>\n\n<p>I think the thing that separates the two is intent, not in the size of the pool of stuff or in the presence of an audience, but rather in the implied purpose of the gathering of content. To me, collecting is usually about propagation—the collection grows in quantity and diversity. Curating seems to be about illumination, and having that set of selected items, no matter the size, come to a point.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve recently launched another blog called <a href=\"http://www.themavenist.org\">The Mavenist</a>, which could be considered a collection, but it feels to be squarely in the realm of curation. What is the difference? It is in the arrangement. Collecting is having all the pearls lose on the table, curating is stringing them together into a necklace. (Of course, there is no better or worse between those two situations. One just has an extra pass of arrangement.) This is why <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/frank-sparrow/favorites/\">my Flickr favorites</a> feels like a collection, while a <a href=\"http://www.pictorymag.com/showcases/danger/\">feature on Pictory</a> is definitely a curatorial endeavor.</p>\n\n<p>I’d say that the web seems to be mostly comprised of collections, because we don’t frequently arrange the things that we have found. Curation is marked by a larger structure, a gestalt made by the arrangement of individual items, sort of like a constellation of stars. The first step of curation, much like collecting, is selecting (and there is an art to that). The second is arranging and sorting those things in a purposeful way. We choose the stars in a constellation, but they become Orion’s Belt because of their position, arrangement, and the prescribed meaning we put on that particular arrangement.</p>\n\n<p>This means that it’s worth considering how we sort things on the web. Information architecture luminary <a href=\"http://www.wurman.com/rsw/\">Richard Saul Wurman</a> said that all information can be arranged in a few different ways. He called it LATCH:</p>\n<ul><li>Location</li><li>Alphabet</li><li>Time</li><li>Category</li><li>Hierarchy</li></ul><p>Right now, chronological ordering is the default way to arrange content online, and I wonder how that blanket presumption affects curation on the web. Does it make sense, because people check in frequently, or is it odd, like sorting a stack of photographs alphabetically by who is in them? There are indeed instances where sorting by time is the correct path, but it will be exciting over the next few months and years to see what happens to the web as we recognize the instances where the newest thing is not necessarily the most important thing. (And, as always, the additional problem on top of this: can this sorting process be automated?)</p>\n\n<p>But can you curate on the web? Most curation comes to a point through narrative, and is narrative possible on the web? Stories require a certain amount of linearity, and we all know how the web disrupts that. Maybe it is the same problem that video games have, where <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6625747/la-noire\">interactivity subverts storytelling.</a> In my own attempts, I’ve tried to create narrative by using the one linear experience I could find: <a href=\"http://www.lostworldsfairs.com/atlantis/\">scrolling.</a> I’m still not sure on this one, because scrolling to tell a story, while fun, doesn’t really scale across the web.</p>\n\n<p>But is scrolling through a collection the same? I think it’s important to note that while we may collect for ourselves, those collections are being published, creating incidental audiences. I collect my Flickr favorites for me, but they are accessible to you, so what obligations do I have to you when I consider to favorite something? What happens when sharing is the default rather than purposeful? It blurs the line between curation and collecting into something more of a gradient than a binary this-or-that. And that’s why those neat definitions in the tweets seem slightly off. The situation isn’t as tidy as it used to be. The line between curating and collecting has turned into a situation similar to when you ask someone to describe what makes something vulgar. The answer for both is the same: “I’ll know it when I see it.”</p>"

      "content" : "<p>While at Maker Faire this last weekend, I got into a conversation with a couple of other geek dads who tracked me down to talk about LEGO robotics. As we stood in a food line, we discussed our hobbies, our kids (all three of us were sans children at the event), and growing up geek. The talk ended with us discussing our various gaming backgrounds as kids, specifically early video games and computer games. I wrote last week about my <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/05/returning-to-my-gaming-roots-by-revisiting-infocom-text-adventures/\">renewed interest in the Infocom games</a> and we all enjoyed sharing our favorite moments from some of those great text-adventure games. (Apologies to Tyler for spoiling the ending of <em>Infidel</em>… I can’t believe I griped about it without checking to make certain they’d played it.)</p>\n<p>After we all had written down some games we’d missed and would be checking out, Sam mentioned X-Com. All three of us yelled so loudly that we got funny looks from the other families enjoying their lunch around us. Who knew a 20+ year old game would still have such an effect on three grown men?</p>\n<div style=\"width:210px\"><a rel=\"attachment wp-att-69039\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/05/geekdad-retro-gaming-x-com-ufo-defense/xcom1/\"><img title=\"XCOM1\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/XCOM1-200x124.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"124\"></a><p>Real Satellite View - Honest</p></div>\n<p>If you’ve played <em>X-Com</em>, then you likely know the draw to it and can understand. If you’ve heard of <em>X-Com</em> but never played it, you’ve likely heard a dozen or more arguments why you should go hunt it down and play. And if you’ve never heard of <em>X-Com</em>, I wish I could trade places with you and enjoy the game again as a completely new and unaware player.</p>\n<p><em>X-Com</em> doesn’t have the modern day graphics as you can see from the included screenshots. It’s turn-based, too — meaning that in combat game mode you specify the actions you wish to take (or more accurately, that you wish for your soldiers to take) and then after the characters have moved, fired their weapons, ducked behind cover, or lost their minds… well, then it’s the aliens’ turn.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div style=\"width:210px\"><a rel=\"attachment wp-att-69040\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/05/geekdad-retro-gaming-x-com-ufo-defense/xcom2/\"><img title=\"XCOM2\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/XCOM2-200x122.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"122\"></a><p>Run away!</p></div>\n<p>The game is about alien invasion and Earth’s attempt to fight back. But the game isn’t all about fighting the aliens. This game has so much more: base building, tech researching, manufacturing, dogfights between UFOs and fighter jets, and even money management practice! The game simply doesn’t let up while you’re playing. Once you build that first base, you’ve got to buy ammo and missiles for your jets, build new facilities (tip: get an alien containment facility up fast for captured alien prisoners), select the best alien technology to research, assign engineers to duplicate alien tech, load up your transport, and, oh yeah… intercept and shoot down marauding UFOs and then send the soldiers in to mop up, collect any prisoners and weapons, and head home to rest for the next battle.</p>\n<div style=\"width:210px\"><a rel=\"attachment wp-att-69041\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/05/geekdad-retro-gaming-x-com-ufo-defense/xcom3/\"><img title=\"XCOM3\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/XCOM3-200x124.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"124\"></a><p>All Your Base Are Belong to Us</p></div>\n<p>Once a month, however, you’ll find the aliens mounting a more aggressive Terror Attack. You’ve got to send in your best soldiers, arm them to the teeth, and hope they can exit the transport and get to cover before being ambushed by the surprisingly good and sneaky computer-controlled aliens. (I’ve renamed my soldiers after GeekDad contributors — sorry, Ken, but you were quickly taken over by alien mind control and started shooting at your buddies. You had to be put down.)</p>\n<p>As the game progresses, the aliens get more powerful and the governments of the world raise their expectations and reward successful missions (and sometimes ally with the aliens if results start to slide). You’ve got to keep researching, keep manufacturing, and keep building new bases. I’ve just started a new game, but one old game that sticks out in my mind had a final count of 10 bases spread over the globe — the most fun attacks are the base attacks where you’ve got to defend your base from the aliens.  Failure is not an option, so SAVE frequently!</p>\n<div style=\"width:210px\"><a rel=\"attachment wp-att-69042\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/05/geekdad-retro-gaming-x-com-ufo-defense/xcom4/\"><img title=\"XCOM4\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/XCOM4-200x125.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"125\"></a><p>Seriously?! I just deplaned!</p></div>\n<p>Over time you’ll discover a large assortment of aliens with all sorts of surprises, including hints of a bigger conspiracy that will lead to the endgame that is out of this world.</p>\n<p><em>X-Com: UFO Defense</em> is, and always will be, one of my all-time favorite games. It just doesn’t get old. You can play a bit, save your progress, and come back later to pick up where you left off — no checkpoints, no multiplayer, and no in-game purchases required. It’s old school fun.</p>\n<p>If you like the game and haven’t played the sequel, <em>X-Com: Terror from the Deep</em>, it’s just as good (some argue that it’s even better). I can remember spending hours sending my soldiers to the various nooks and crannies of a cruise ship that was the site of a Terror Landing — those aliens were devious and always hiding in the smallest rooms or circling around to surprise you from behind. (There are even more sequels but I haven’t heard much good about anything beyond <em>X-COM: TftD</em> – any readers want to chime in?)</p>\n<div style=\"width:210px\"><a rel=\"attachment wp-att-69043\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/05/geekdad-retro-gaming-x-com-ufo-defense/xcom5/\"><img title=\"XCOM5\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/XCOM5-200x124.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"124\"></a><p>Why is Ken acting funny?</p></div>\n<p><em>X-Com: UFO Defense</em> can be purchased from Steam (<a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/news/\">steampowered.com</a>) for $4.99, an unbelievable price for a game that will give you hours of enjoyment.</p>\n<p>And for those of you who have finished <em>X-Com: UFO Defense</em> and are looking for more, I’ve got great news for you — an homage to <em>X-Com</em> called <a href=\"http://xenonauts.com/\">Xenonauts </a>is close to completion. I’ll be putting up a detailed review in the weeks to come, and I’m going to have to try really hard to remain impartial. It’ll be a tough assignment, but I’ll push through and try to keep a smile off my face as I play.</p>\n<p>Sharing time — geek dads, any great experiences to share about <em>X-Com</em> games? Please remember to label spoilers or just avoid them altogether if possible.

      "content" : "<div><p>A lot of my time as a design executive is spent defending the value of the unquantifiable. Business pressures argue for design compromises with some quantifiable and significant ROI (Return on Investment). But as Adaptive Path put it in their report on <a href=\"http://adaptivepath.com/ideas/reports/businessvalue\">Leveraging Business Value: How ROI Changes User Experience</a>, “It’s impossible to measure ROI for user experience with a simple equation that can be applied across a wide swath of companies and projects.” And, in my experience, perhaps the hardest thing to quantify is the value of negative space: the space <em>between</em> your user interface elements.</p>\n<p>Typically brand new apps have lots of space, because UI elements represent features, which require code, which requires time and money. With time and money, however, the app evolves, and the empty space is quickly filled in with new features. The availability of room, in fact, can contribute greatly to the decision to place a button in what was previously empty space. “Users are asking for this feature, and it looks like there’s room for us to squeeze in another button on the toolbar, so let’s do the feature and make it a toolbar button.”</p>\n<p>I rarely hear discussion about setting aside room in a user interface for the <em>absence</em> of user interface elements. Speaking both aesthetically and from a usability perspective, negative space can be highly valuable in an interface. Used effectively, it can create a sense of calm, balance, manageability, and competence. It can help guide the user’s eyes across the page towards what’s important. The presence of space can separate things that are different; the absence of space can join things that are similar.</p>\n<p>Cozi’s current web page template leaves some significant negative space in the lower left (above the clock), as well as a bit in the upper right. Both those spaces vary in size depending on the window dimensions. (The calendar view itself also has considerable space, but that’s highly dependent on which view is selected and how much data is on the calendar.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://miksovsky.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451fb6769e20154326e3f8a970c-pi\"><img alt=\"2010.09.17\" border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://miksovsky.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451fb6769e2014e888ee2ff970d-pi\" style=\"background-image:none;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;display:inline;padding-top:0px;border:0px\" title=\"2010.09.17\" width=\"640\"></a></p>\n<p>The challenge is that negative space doesn’t <em>look</em> like it’s doing anything. It can appear inefficient—like a lost opportunity. In a business driven by display advertising, there is pressure to make pixels generate revenue. It’s nearly impossible to count the value that effective negative space contributes to a user experience, but it’s very easy to estimate the rent those same pixels might generate if they were converted to display advertising inventory. The thing is, those empty pixels <em>are</em> doing something. The user experience would be different—worse—if the space were filled.</p>\n<p>(The Leaderboard ad in the image above is actually a different problem. That ad isn’t filling space that was previously empty; it’s consuming space that would otherwise be used to show user data. See my earlier post on why <a href=\"http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2010/08/its-easier-to-imagine-hiding-an-ad-than-completely-redesigning-a-ui.html\">it’s easier for users to image hiding an ad than completely redesigning a UI</a>.)</p>\n<p>Negative space is hard concept to love, but it turns out that most people demonstrate an intuitive grasp of negative space in the context of their own homes. In home after home, you can observe that the occupants have very carefully hung pictures or paintings on the wall so as to give each piece space to breathe. You will rarely see a bunch of paintings crammed together on a wall. Most people effectively use negative space with no training beyond the casual observations of positive examples in other homes, museums, offices, or anywhere art is displayed. At some subconscious level, people must be so sensitive to the value of negative space that they are willing to do work to preserve negative space in their own surroundings.</p>\n<p>The defense of the negative space in a user experience, however, is a never-ending battle. New proposals to “fill that space in” with a new feature, ad, or other element arise on a monthly, sometimes weekly, basis. Defense of the open space is wearisome but necessary. Once that’s space is gone, it’s usually gone forever.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/flowstate/~4/sDYdnr-Q1GE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></div>"

He sees this as a distinctly transhuman or posthuman perspective, a sensibility that everyone might share in a future with intelligent robots and uplifted animals.</p>\n<p>It's tempting to say, \"well, all animated movies are about talking animals and toys,\" but the difference is that in Pixar movies this is treated as a significant issue. We're not in a <em>101 Dalmations</em> universe of fantasy, where we just take for granted that dogs talk because the movie is from the dogs' point of view. Instead, we're in a world of humans and non-human sentient creatures, and the non-humans often have to work hard to persuade the humans that they deserve what amount to human rights. Here's what Munkittrick writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In each Pixar film, at least one member of the team is human and at least one member is not human but possesses human levels of intelligence.</p>\n<p>You can see where I'm going here. Particularly in <em>WALL•E, Ratatouille</em> and <em>Up!</em> there is no ambiguity about the reality of intelligence in the non-human characters. Each Pixar film asks us to accept one deviation from our reality. While it seems like the deviation is different in every case (e.g. monsters are real, robots can fall in love, fish have a sense of family, Kevin is a girl, a rat can cook), the simple fact is that</p>\n<p>Pixar only asks us to accept one idea over and over and over again: <strong>Non-humans are sentient beings. That is the central difference between Pixar's universe and our current reality</strong> . . .</p>\n<p>Taken together as a whole narrative, the Pixar canon diagrams what will likely this century's main rights battle – the rights of personhood – in three stages.</p>\n<p><strong>First</strong> are the Humans as Villain stories, in which the non-humans discover and develop personhood. I mean, Buzz Lightyear's character arc is about his becoming self-aware as a toy. These films represent nascent personhood among non-human entities. For the viewer, we begin to see how some animals and items we see as mindless may have inner lives of which we are unaware.</p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong> are the Humans as Partners stories, in which exceptional non-humans and exceptional humans share a moment of mutual recognition of personhood. The moment when Linguini realizes Remy is answering him is second only to the moment when Remy shows Ego around the kitchen – such beautiful transformations of the Other into the self. These films represent the first forays of non-human persons into seeking parity with human beings.</p>\n<p><strong>Third</strong>, and finally, there is The Incredibles, which turns the personhood equation on its head. Instead of portraying the struggle for non-humans to be accepted as human, The Incredibles shows how human enhancement, going beyond the human norm, will trigger equally strong reactions of revulsion and otherization. The message, however, is that the human traits we value have nothing to do with our physical powers but are instead based in our moral and emotional bonds. Beneficence and courage require far more humanity than raw might. The Incredibles teaches a striking lesson: human enhancement does not make you inhuman – the choices you make and the way you treat others determines how human you really are.</p>\n<p>Pixar has given those who would fight for personhood the narratives necessary to convince the world that non-humans that display characteristics of a person deserve the rights of a person. For every category there is a character: uplifted animals (Dug), naturally intelligent species (Remy and Kevin), A.I robots (WALL-E, EVE), and alien/monsters (Sully &amp; Mike). Then there is the Incredible family, transhumans with superpowers. Through the films, these otherwise strange entities become unmistakably familiar, so clearly akin to us.</p>\n<p><strong>The message hidden inside Pixar's magnificent films is this: humanity does not have a monopoly on personhood. In whatever form non- or super-human intelligence takes, it will need brave souls on both sides to defend what is right. If we can live up to this burden, humanity and the world we live in will be better for it.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/sciencenotfiction/2011/05/14/the-hidden-message-in-pixars-films/\">Read the full article</a> over at Discover's Science Not Fiction blog</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.gawker.com/~ff/io9/vip?a=Sd9Qgt0nCtM:iFJ9FvoAcTI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/io9/vip?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.gawker.com/~ff/io9/vip?a=Sd9Qgt0nCtM:iFJ9FvoAcTI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/io9/vip?i=Sd9Qgt0nCtM:iFJ9FvoAcTI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.gawker.com/~ff/io9/vip?a=Sd9Qgt0nCtM:iFJ9FvoAcTI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/io9/vip?i=Sd9Qgt0nCtM:iFJ9FvoAcTI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.gawker.com/~ff/io9/vip?a=Sd9Qgt0nCtM:iFJ9FvoAcTI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/io9/vip?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/io9/vip/~4/Sd9Qgt0nCtM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljpj1yRs8s1qz5dkl.png\"></p>\n\n<p>Earlier this week AIGA sponsored a round-table discussion with every designer on Twitter called <a href=\"http://www.onedayfordesign.org/\">One Day for Design.</a> As expected, it was a cacophony of noise with the occasional delightful or insightful nugget. It was less discussion and more a match of wits battling in profundity (with a bit of jest directed at the whole thing too). The event wound up, to my eyes, not so much a dialogue, but more a sequence of soundbites trying to be strung together into a dialogue. I feel for the moderators who were given the impossible task of trying to make sense of the mess and herd cats. They are smart, capable people that were put in a weird spot with a tough job.</p>\n\n<p>Part of this has to do with the format. It’s very difficult to have a “listening state” on Twitter, and great conversations seem to be built more on listening than speaking. On top of that, Twitter is a difficult mechanism to corral into a conversation because it doesn’t let you curate tweets into a linear sequence of events. Twitter handles back and forth between 2 and 3 people relatively well, but breaks once more people involved. Twitter seemed like the wrong place for the discussion, because it presented a conversation on design that required holistic thinking in a fragmented manner.</p>\n\n<p>In spite of this, I perceive there still to be value to the event. Even though Twitter does not seem to be an ideal mechanism in the search for answers to complex questions, it can be an important tool for raising the appropriate questions on the minds of the masses. Encouraging designers to speak their thoughts on design is an excellent way to get the pulse of the industry. And, in response, I saw some questions and points that delighted me and others that fatigued or even saddened me.</p>\n\n<p>I feel compelled to present a few designers’ poisons. In my opinion, these are the dispositions and mistakes of the field that I saw both addressed as problems and manifested in behavior in One Day for Design’s live stream. These are the things that hurt all of us. I am not above or excluded from any of these points. In fact, I’m more guilty than most in some of these.</p><p>This list is an incomplete one, but I presume a partial list is better than not collecting them at all. I present these as my contribution to the discussion about creating a way forward for the profession. There are a few proposed answers in here, but they are given in the spirit of discussion rather than authority. We’re all part of the same profession, and the AIGA is correct in recognizing there are important issues that need to be addressed that have a great influence on the future of our profession.</p>\n\n<ol><li><strong>A lack of definition for design.</strong> Isn’t it a bit ironic that a group of communicators can’t summon a definition for their practice? I won’t pretend that finding this definition is easy. We’ll never achieve absolute clarity in a definition, but it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t strive to define the practice. This lack of definition creates so many of the issues faced by designers both internally and externally. I’ve a hunch that it’s not as easy as “problem-solving,” because “problem” is as sticky of a word as “design.” Generally, we’ve done such wonderful work branding our clients, and such a poor job branding ourselves.</li>\n\n<li><strong>The public’s general understanding of design as a noun.</strong> So much tension happens in client work because many clients believe the value of the designer is the things that they make, the noun. The designer, meanwhile, believes that the core of their value comes from the process, the strategy. The verb; hence the rise of “design thinking.” This fundamental disagreement of the placement of value of a designer’s services creates a lot of misunderstandings.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Not considering design a liberal art, and entrenching ourselves in the opinion that this is a craft for the few, rather than a skill for the many.</strong> If we believe design is such a valuable lens to view the world through and a fantastic mental mode for problem solving, we should open it up to everyone. Not doing so is double-speak.</li>\n\n<li><strong>The miseducation of a designer.</strong> If it’s wrong for a client to believe the value of design is in the nouns, it’s also incorrect to educate a designer around nouns. Curriculums shouldn’t be focused towards teaching software or creating specific artifacts. The education of a designer should not be focused towards working in specific mediums any longer, because those mediums change so frequently and often congeal into one another into new hybrids. Everything is a campaign now. Schools would be wise to focus activity around objectives rather than tasks, because so much of professional work is around objectives too: devising plans to fulfill those objectives, creating a symphony of efforts that work together towards that goal, and then executing those efforts in a way that adds value. By focusing on objectives, curriculum will age better because instructors can be agile about the tools that they teach as the world around the university changes.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Asking the wrong questions.</strong> We shouldn’t be asking “Do I need to learn how to program?” We should be asking “Would making websites help achieve the goals of our clients?” More often than not, it will, so we should work towards making ourselves skillful in that enterprise or surrounding ourselves with those that are. The issue is that the question about programming is task based, and the other is objective based. One focused on How, the other on Why.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Designers wanting a seat at the table, but frequently not inviting clients to our own table.</strong> To extend this point: How much more interesting would it have been if several people that frequently commission design were part of the One Day for Design conversation? I suppose there was nothing keeping them out of the conversation, but generally it seemed the event was painted as something for designers. What if AIGA’s salary survey was complementary to a client inquiry survey? By listening to our clients, we become better at servicing them. In addition to this, it becomes less easy to paint ourselves as victims, which is generally an unsavory disposition for a profession. <a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2833-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-coudal-\">As Jim Coudal says,</a> if you’re making fun of your clients at the bar, something is wrong.</li>\n\n<li><strong>The self-serving nature of design.</strong> So much work by designers for designers. I’m as guilty of this as anyone else (perhaps, even more guilty), but to achieve a resonance and understanding to the value of design, I suggest that we must look to audiences beyond ourselves and prove that value by improving their lives with our work.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Villainizing criticism.</strong> The measure of a mature practice is reflection and analysis. Painting serious criticism of the field as unnecessary or labeling the critics as second-class because they don’t “make anything” cuts the development of field off at the knees. Criticism and creation have a symbiotic relationship. It is reflexive. Criticism provides a valuable rudder to the mode of making, and to eliminate it leaves us floating. </li>\n\n<li><strong>Undervaluing philosophy.</strong> This one seems odd, but I suggest that there is an unexplored gravitas to the work that we do, not necessarily because there is a profound quality to design itself, but rather because of the promises the work makes. The core question of Aristotelian philosophy and ethics is “What is the good life?” How is such a desirous question not brought up more frequently in a field that works so much in human wants and desires, a field that so frequently promises happiness not only for its practitioners, but for its audience as well?</li>\n\n<li><strong>Our cognitive bias towards the uniqueness of our challenges.</strong> It is tempting to think that the problems we face are the first time these problems have risen. Not necessarily so. As interaction designers explore the problem to document their work, are they not facing the same problem as an installation artist or a performance artist in their effort to document the work without turning an experience into an image? This challenge is not unique to design, though it feels profoundly stronger here than elsewhere (which is probably another cognitive bias of my own).</li> </ol>"

This was a living room where a very ill person would mostly die soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hospital bed's defining feature was the theoretical ease with which the human trunk  slumped in its top half could be raised or lowered by turning a shitty little crank at the foot of its lower half. Like the bed itself, the shitty little crank was ugly and obtrusive and hard to live with. Mom and I tripped over the crank  a lot.</p>\n\n<p>The theoretically useful but ultimately shitty little crank  made the hospital bed look like those old-timey cars we'd see in  the bad silent movies they showed down at Shakey's Pizza.</p>\n\n<p>Mom and Dad <em>despised</em> the saltines-and-ketchup style of pizza served at Shakey's. To them, LaRosa's  over  on Cheviot had way better pizza plus a pretty good jukebox. But, I <em>really</em> liked Shakey's. They gave away cool styrofoam boater hats with a red paper band that said, \"Shakey's Pizza Parlor.\" Which I thought looked smashing. So, they used to take me to Shakey's.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, the hospital bed's shitty little crank functioned mostly as a recalcitrant and pinch-inducing mechanism for eroding my father's dignity.</p>\n\n<p>Dad would lay in the hospital bed that filled our living room while my Mom slowly cranked. He'd try to make jokes. (Dad had always been the funniest person any of his friends knew.)  The hospital bed creaked. Mom cranked. Dad's tired upper half would haltingly rise and bob with reluctant help from the bed's upper half. Mom sweated at the crank. Dad laid there and watched. Dad couldn't help. He watched. He was in the hospital bed. Mom did all the cranking. Dad watched. He watched while his wife turned a shitty little iron crank, trying impotently to make her best friend just a tiny bit more comfortable as his body worked  to finally  finish eating itself. But, he couldn't help out. I think he wanted to help out. But, he couldn't help out.</p>\n\n<p>She couldn't really help my Dad. My Dad couldn't really help her. But they sure tried.</p>\n\n<p>She cranked and cranked.</p>\n\n<p>I was seven. I didn't know how to help anyone.</p>\n\n<h2>2.</h2>\n\n<p>The last time I saw my Dad, he was in a different hospital bed. That one was a much more functional and aesthetically appropriate unit neatly fitted into an overlit semi-private room in the highly-regarded Jewish Hospital located on E. Galbraith Road. We weren't Jewish. We were just sick.</p>\n\n<p>Frankly, I forget what the crank on the second hospital bed looked like, but I  seem to recall that it  worked just fine.</p>\n\n<p>This was maybe a week before my Dad died.</p>\n\n<p>From what I can gather, he and my Mom had wanted to time things so that I could be with him as long and as late as possible--but not so late that I'd have to see him in the kind of condition I have to assume he was in during the full week he was too ill for his boy to visit him. Pretty bad condition, I'm guessing.</p>\n\n<p>In the almost forty years since Dad's last  week in any hospital bed, my Mom and I haven't talked much about it. If there are things to say about that week, I'm not sure even forty years is long enough to prep for them. I know I'm still not ready. I should ask my Mom if she's ready. She was forty then. Just under half her life ago.</p>\n\n<p>What I do know is my Mom lived by  that second hospital bed most every minute of Dad's last week. Just like she'd been by the first hospital bed in her living room for the months before.  Only now <em>she</em> was the one sleeping on the wrong bed. There are limits to the physical comforts you can offer  a woman who's determined to stay by her husband's second hospital bed until it's time.</p>\n\n<p>But she <em>was</em> there that whole time. Up to the last time my sweet Dad ever said anything to anyone.</p>\n\n<p>As he laid in that second hospital bed, I'm told that the last thing my Dad said to anyone was something he said to my Mom. He told my Mom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Take care of The Big Guy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That was me. I was \"The Big Guy.\" My Dad always called me \"Big Guy,\" and I always loved when he said that. It made me feel strong. It made me feel tall. It made me know that my Dad and I were  best pals.</p>\n\n<p>I still love knowing I was my Dad's best pal.</p>\n\n<h2>3.</h2>\n\n<p>I don't specifically remember the day  our particular clutch of burly rental guys came out to remove the first hospital bed from our living room. I do remember thinking it was weird how quickly the space   filled with huge floral arrangements, covered dishes and casseroles, and a pack of outdoorsy men with giant red hands who were new to sobbing inconsolably in front of each other.</p>\n\n<p>But, that hospital bed had been heavy. Really heavy. And even though the bed's wheels had been thoughtfully nested in plastic casters, the raw tonnage of the iron motherfucker left permanent dents in our ugly, broccoli-green carpeting. Six breadplate-sized dents that were still there a year and a half later on the day my Mom and I moved out.</p>\n\n<p>We didn't need a house that big for just the two of us. Plus, the living room wasn't much fun to hang out in any more.</p>\n\n<p>Way too big.  Way too big.</p>\n\n<h2>4.</h2>\n\n<p>I don't currently have a hospital bed. I have a modest but very comfortable  regular bed in a regular bedroom where I sleep  with my regular wife. She's my favorite part of the bed.</p>\n\n<p>To my knowledge, our modest but very comfortable bed is not fitted with a shitty little crank. Which is nice for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>And, every single morning at almost exactly 6:00 AM Pacific Time, my three-year-old daughter wakes up, jumps out of her crank-free, regular, big-girl bed, tears out of her regular bedroom, and--even before she gets her hot milk or takes off her pull-up or tells us to turn on <em>Toy Story 2</em>--she dashes into our regular bedroom, runs up to our regular non-hospital bed, and screams, \"<strong>DAD-dy! DAD-dy! DAD-dy!</strong>\" until I wake up and say, \"G'mornin', Sweet Bug! Did you have nice sleeps?\"</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes she tells me whether or not she had nice sleeps. Often as not lately, she tells me to make her hot milk and turn on <em>Toy Story 2</em>. Both of which I'm totally fine with.</p>\n\n<p>Thing is, she screams \"<strong>DAD-dy!</strong>\" like the most impossibly great thing in the world has just happened. Every single morning. Right by my bed. Without a crank in sight.</p>\n\n<p>And, you know what? Something impossibly great <em>has</em> happened.</p>\n\n<p>Because an annoying, rambling, disagreeable little man like me gets to have this alarm clock in piggy-patterned footie jammies run up to a regular, crank-less, healthy-Dad,  non-hospital bed and make him feel like he's <em>The Greatest Thing in the Universe</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Just like I think she's The Greatest Thing in the Universe.</p>\n\n<p>Just like I thought <em>my</em> Dad was The Greatest Thing in the Universe.</p>\n\n<p>And, although I'm confident that I will <em>always</em> think my daughter is The Greatest Thing in the Universe, I'm also all too aware that this feeling will not always be reciprocated in quite that same way or with quite that same enthusiasm that we both enjoy right now.</p>\n\n<p>She won't always run to my bed in footie jammies.</p>\n\n<p>I'll only get that particularly noisy and personalized wake-up call for a little while. And, I only get a shot at it once a day. At almost exactly 6:00 AM Pacific Time.</p>\n\n<p>Then one day? I won't get it any more. It will be gone.</p>\n\n<h2>5.</h2>\n\n<p>Many mornings over the past six months or so, at almost exactly 6:00 AM Pacific Time, I was not in my regular bed. I was not even at home. I was sitting in another building, typing bullshit that I hoped would please my book editor. Who, by the way, is <em>awesome</em>.</p>\n\n<p>And, if I noticed what time it was, I'd always wonder whether my daughter had run into our bedroom yet.</p>\n\n<p>I'd wonder whether she had seen my side of the bed empty again. And, when I thought about my empty spot on the bed and how disappointed she'd be to scream \"<strong>DAD-dy! DAD-dy! DAD-dy!</strong>\" then see I'm not even there, I'd die a little.</p>\n\n<p>I'd die a  little, because as I thought about her, I'd think about <em>my</em> Dad. And as I thought about my Dad, I'd start thinking about hospital beds with cranks--then on to dents, and covered dishes, and rooms full of sobbing outdoorsy guys, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>But, by then it might be 6:10 am Pacific Time. And I didn't have time to think about my family. Not now, right?  No, I had to keep working. I had to stay in that other  building and   keep typing bullshit that I hoped would please my editor. Who is awesome.</p>\n\n<p>So, I'd type and type. I'd crank and crank. I'd try and try. I'd  want <em>very much</em>  to go home, make hot milk, and watch <em>Toy Story 2</em>. So much, I'd want this.</p>\n\n<h2>6.</h2>\n\n<p>Anyhow, this has been my on-and-off job for the past two years. I type. And, I try to type things that will help and comfort people, but mostly I try to type things that will  please my editor. Who is awesome.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I do my job at 6:00 AM Pacific Time. Sometimes I do my job at 5:30 PM or 11:30 AM or really any time in between. Sometimes I do my job while my family goes to birthday parties and holiday dinners and a couple vacations and I don't even know how many (non-Shakey's) pizza nights--all without me. <em>Without Dad.</em></p>\n\n<p>In fact, a depressing amount of the time--really up until this week--I would do my job until I hadn't the slightest idea what time it was or what bullshit I was typing or what my crank was ever meant to be attached to in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>But, even when my shitty little crank was not attached to anything, I did keep cranking. Because, Dads do their job. It's what they <em>do</em>.</p>\n\n<p>They crank. They crank and crank and crank and crank.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the cranking made something special that will be really useful to people who badly need the comfort and help. But, a staggering amount of the time, my cranking has produced joyless and unemotional bullshit that couldn't comfort, help, or <em>please</em> anyone. Especially my editor. Who is awesome.  There's no point in doing anything if it doesn't eventually please my editor. Who is awesome.</p>\n\n<p>This has <em>constantly</em> hung over my head. For two fucking years.</p>\n\n<p>But, this has been my job. It's a job I often did late. It's a job I often did poorly. And, it's a job where I often didn't pull my load or live up to even my own expectations and standards. Which is far from my editor's fault.</p>\n\n<p>She's been awesome.</p>\n\n<h2>7.</h2>\n\n<p>Anyhow, I've tried to do my job. But, I've often failed.</p>\n\n<p>I've sometimes failed to make things that will  help and comfort people. And, God knows I've failed to please my editor.</p>\n\n<p>And, worst of all, more often than my heart can bear at 2:34 pm Pacific Time on Friday April 22nd, I know I've failed to be home for several of my daily shot at \"<strong>DAD-dy! DAD-dy! DAD-dy!</strong>\"</p>\n\n<p>It's now become unavoidably clear to me that I've been doing each of these things poorly. The job, the making, the pleasing, and, yeah, the being at home. And I can't live with that for another day. So, I've chosen which one has to go. At least in the way it's worked to date. Which is to say <em>not</em> working.</p>\n\n<p>I'll let you guess which.</p>\n\n<p>Because, <em>that</em>? That choosing? That's what my book needs to be about. Not about pleasing people. Not about cranking on bullshit. Not about abandoning your priorities to write about priorities.</p>\n\n<p>My book needs to be about choosing a  hard thing and then living with it. Because it's <em>your thing</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But, that part's gone missing for just a little too long now. Certainly not missing from my handsome and very practical rhetoric--it's been missing from my actual life and <em>living</em>. In a quest to make something that has increasingly not felt like my own, I've unintentionally ignored my own counsel  to never let your hard work fuck up the good things. Including those regular people. Including, ironically, the real work. Including any good thing the crank is supposed to be attached to.</p>\n\n<p>So, I'm done fucking that up. I'm done cranking. And, I'm ready to make a change.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure precisely what that change will look like, but, at the risk of invoking Godwin's Law, I have a pretty good idea that this particular performance of \"Edelweiss\" you're enjoying right now may immediately be followed by a dramatic chase, a hopeful escape attempt, and only if I'm extremely lucky, maybe an eventual stride over the Alps.</p>\n\n<p>As I'll explain in a minute, it most likely means I don't have My Book Contract any more.</p>\n\n<p>Who knows? We'll have to see.</p>\n\n<h2>8.</h2>\n\n<p>All I know is tonight's Friday. And, that's Daddy-Daughter Night.</p>\n\n<p>And, my book agent says my editor (who is awesome) will probably cancel My Book Contract if I don't send her <em>something</em> that pleases her…today. Now. By tonight. Theoretically, I guess...uh...<em>this</em>.</p>\n\n<p>See: my agent very helpfully suggested I send my editor a chapter full of \"email stuff.\" My editor <em>really</em> likes \"email stuff.\" And, it was theorized by my agent that sending this \"email stuff\" might please my book editor just enough that she  might  not cancel My Book Contract. For now.</p>\n\n<p>Well. If you've made it this far, you, like my editor (who is awesome), will have realized that this is not a chapter of \"email stuff.\"</p>\n\n<p>It's a very long, wooly, histrionic, <em>messy</em> and uncomfortable story about hospital beds, piggy jammies, and styrofoam hats. I seriously doubt it will please my editor. Who is awesome.</p>\n\n<p>So, no, I really hope she doesn't cancel My Book Contract. But, it does occur to me that said contract is the last and only thing my publisher has to intimidate me into doing things I don't want to do. Things I think will harm my book, my integrity, and my life.</p>\n\n<p>Once that threat is made good, the game ends. They can sue me and yell and stuff. Which would suck, but at least no one would be demanding my book have fucking <a href=\"http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/4767165831/where-the-fuck-do-i-begin\">pussy willows on the cover</a>. Which, as I sit here,  feels more and more unbearable to me.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I don't control anything that anyone does. It took a long time for me to really get that.</p>\n\n<p>It's such a funny thing. Threats--like hurricanes and rectal exams--are only scary until they arrive. Once they're over, they're just the basis for funny stories. But, you do nearly always survive them. And, if you didn't survive? It wasn't because of a lack of fear. Like I say, <a href=\"http://www.43folders.com/2011/03/28/scared-shitless\">the universe doesn't particularly care</a> whether you're scared.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, well. I like my editor. She's awesome. I hope she doesn't cancel My Book Contract. I hope we keep working together.</p>\n\n<p>But if it goes away today, tomorrow or further on? Well. As a favorite novelist of mine used to say: \"<em>So it goes.</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>I'll figure this out tomorrow. Or Monday. Or later. Tonight is Daddy-Daughter Night. And, no fucking way am I missing two in a row.</p>\n\n<h2>9.</h2>\n\n<p>Now, as far as My Goddamned Book? Truthfully? Wanna hear the <em>really</em> complicated part?</p>\n\n<p>This is not me  quitting the book. No fucking way. This is me doubling down on the book--on <em>my</em> book.</p>\n\n<p>I will finish <em>my</em> book very soon. Not because of (or in spite of) any contract, and not because of (or in spite of)  any editor, and certainly not because of (or in spite of) any tacit demand  for empty cranking.</p>\n\n<p>I will finish <em>my</em> book because <em>I</em> want to finish it. Because it is very, very important to <em>me</em> to finish it.</p>\n\n<p>But, again, let's be clear-- what I finish will be <em>my book</em>. And, it will be done <em>my way</em>. And, yes--you <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/b2w/12\">Back to Work</a> fans knew <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/afterdark/16\">this one was coming</a>--my book will have <a href=\"http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/4767165831/where-the-fuck-do-i-begin\"><em>my</em> cover that <em>I</em> choose</a>. It will not have fucking pussy willows or desert islands  or third-rate kerning. It will be, to quote my editor (who is awesome), \"<a href=\"http://cl.ly/3i2d0a122E3F1c1o3J1w\"><em>messy</em></a>.\"</p>\n\n<p>My book will help and comfort the people that <em>I</em> want to reach. And, yes, much like my  editor, my book will be <em>awesome</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I truly hope <em>my</em> book pleases her.</p>\n\n<h2>10.</h2>\n\n<p>So, there you have it. An article that's clearly  not a chapter of \"email stuff.\"</p>\n\n<p>Me? I'm off to prep for \"Daddy-Daughter Night.\"</p>\n\n<p>And, tomorrow morning, unlike last Saturday morning and countless  other days before it, at the crack of 6:00 am Pacific Time, I will be available in my regular crankless bed to ask  my daughter whether she had nice sleeps. And I will tell her and my regular wife that I think they're the Greatest Things in the Universe.</p>\n\n<p>And, maybe after I make hot milk and watch Woody worry about cowboy camp, I may even  think to myself about how proud my funny Dad would be of his pal, The Big Guy. For doing what needed to be done. To be someone special's Dad for as often and as long as he can. Just like he did. Even when it gets hard.</p>\n\n<p>Even when it gets really hard.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">-- 30 --</div>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Thanks for listening, nerds.

After all, at $180, why would you use this instead of just stowing a regular adjustable wrench in your pocket?</p>\n<p>The wrench part is adjusted by a thumb trigger: press it in and slide the ratcheted T-section out, release the trigger to lock. The range runs from 0.1 inches to 0.805 inches, or 2.54 – 20.447 mm. That’s enough for any bolt on your bike, although getting enough leverage with the short handle may make it tricky to get those wheel nuts off.</p>\n<p>If you pop the T-section out all the way, you’ll get a sharp surprise — there’s a knife in there, which is removable for replacement and TSA compliance. Also in the body is a flat/Philips screwdriver bit and the ever-essential bottle opener. The whole thing dangles from a cord, making it the most manly necklace available.</p>\n<p>the CNC-machined tool is made from titanium and stainless steel, and weighs in at a pocket (and neck) friendly 2.9 ounces (82g).

      "direction" : "ltr",
      "content" : "by <a href=\"http://www.theawl.com/author/eric-spiegelman/\" title=\"Posts by Eric Spiegelman\">Eric Spiegelman</a>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/j0HfwkArpvU?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Here are ten videos, culled from the neverending stream of Internet things that pass by my face each day, ten videos that will make you feel good about the world. They&#39;re all from this year, a year that I can say confidently had way more suck than it had awesome; but if you take half an hour to ignore all the suck and watch these you will come away thinking, man, people still make some beautiful things, even in the midst of shit raining down, even if only they&#39;re tiny little Internet videos. This was a running list I started in January, a list I only added to when moved to do so. And there was not much paring down that happened when I looked back at the collection this week, which proves I have very high standards—because let me tell you I saw a LOT of cute animal videos this year, and only two made this list. Looking at them all again, it&#39;s clear that I responded to things that were delightful, clever and sometimes poignant. <span></span></p>\n<p>1) These are in no particular order, but above is clearly the most wonderful video of 2010: &quot;Words,&quot; by Will Hoffman and Daniel Mercadante, produced for WNYC&#39;s Radiolab program to accompany one of its episodes. It probably takes about a minute for you to go, &quot;Oh, I see what they&#39;re doing here,&quot; and then you&#39;ll go back and watch the whole thing again because now you get it. And for anyone who got out a relationship this year, there&#39;s one shot that might just kill you.</p>\n<p>2) The music video for &quot;Red Lights&quot; by the band Holy Fuck elevates the genre of Cats Doing People Things to a level not seen since the 1970s. Indeed, this could be the Internet generation&#39;s <i>The Aristocats</i> or <i>The Cat From Outer Space</i>. Re-imagining the most famous scene in <i>Bullitt</i> as a dog chasing a cat is a &quot;how did nobody think of this yet&quot; kind of genius, but it comes with a danger. When dealing with the obvious yet undiscovered, the bar is automatically set really high, because the audience &quot;gets it&quot; before they even see it and thus demands an execution on par with their expectations. The filmmakers here, Brian Borcherdt and Michael LeBlanc, they do not disappoint.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/DhaRkWfaq10?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></iframe></p>\n<p>3) A couple filmmakers out of Weehawken, New Jersey wanted to get the attention of HBO, so they made a promo spot for &quot;Boxing After Dark,&quot; totally on spec. HBO, turns out, didn&#39;t give a damn. But a lot of other people did, and Liam O&#39;Neil and Jason Koburov found themselves pursued by a number of top talent management firms in Hollywood, who thought they should be in the feature film business instead of the making commercials for free business. It&#39;s easy to see why, since their video, &quot;I Still Have A Soul,&quot; tells a compelling story in just two minutes.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/14462246\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/14462246\">HBO &quot;I Still Have A Soul&quot;</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/paradisesquare\">Paradise Square Films</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>4) This year&#39;s British elections didn&#39;t quite rouse the spontaneous mass creative impulse that characterized the Obama campaign of 2008, but this video made by &quot;nathankw,&quot; a fan of the Lib Dems, wins out over that sappy Will.I.Am video any day.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/aaruPtx-eFM?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></iframe></p>\n<p>5) Creating things for the love of creating things basically defines the Goddamn Cobras Collective, a group of Brooklyn twenty-somethings with day jobs who all get together in their off hours to produce stuff. They have a whole series of local bands doing live covers of popular songs while a bunch of friends sit around and enjoy the performance. This one, &quot;Wakey! Wakey! part 2,&quot; is perhaps the most endearing. It&#39;s a cover of &quot;Ambling Amp&quot; by Yeasayer, all warm and beautifully shot and, damn, I wish I got invited to parties like these. Replacing the synthesizer with a violin was a great idea.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D9805303%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D0%26show_byline%3D0%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D07ad4f%26fullscreen%3D1%26autoplay%3D0%26loop%3D0&amp;width=640&amp;height=360\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/9805303\">Cobra Den Invitational: Wakey!Wakey! – Ambling Alp (Yeasayer)</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/goddamncobras\">Goddamn Cobras Collective</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>6) Hey, remember the Olympics this year? Probably not. (It was a Winter Olympics. Hmm.) But some people really cared about them. Like this group of musicians dressed in the traditional clothing of ethnic Tatars, playing authentic Tatar instruments, and singing a cover of &quot;We Are The Champions.&quot; In one of the Tatar dialects.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/7tyaXaemxsA?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=505\" width=\"640\" height=\"505\"></iframe></p>\n<p>7) Just about everyone on the Internet saw this one, I&#39;m sure, but Patrick Jean&#39;s &quot;Pixels&quot; can be watched again and again without any loss of delight. Classic 8-bit arcade games invade Manhattan. Fantastically clever.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/ugV6cLgwomo?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></iframe></p>\n<p>8) &quot;Oops&quot; won this year&#39;s Vimeo award for best experimental video. Chris Beckman took a bunch of footage of people dropping their cameras while shooting with them, then he edited it all together quite seamlessly. Is it a commentary on our perpetually imperfect relationship with technology? Eh, probably not. But it&#39;s damn compelling and more than a little hypnotic.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D13788278%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D0%26show_byline%3D0%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D00ADEF%26fullscreen%3D1%26autoplay%3D0%26loop%3D0&amp;width=640&amp;height=480\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/13788278\">oops</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/chrisbeckman\">Chris Beckman</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>9) Ok Go could probably have three videos on this list. They &quot;get&quot; the Internet. But I&#39;m going with &quot;White Knuckles,&quot; directed by Trish Sie, as the best of the bunch, because it features the choreography of trained dogs.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/nHlJODYBLKs?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></iframe></p>\n<p>10) My sardonic cousin refers to <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> as the most successful powerpoint deck ever created. That&#39;s the issue with environmentalist message movies, they&#39;re often pretty boring. Or, as in the case of <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i>, just plain stupid. But neither can be said about Ramin Bahrani&#39;s &quot;Plastic Bag,&quot; which follows the journey of a pollutant through the pollutant&#39;s own perspective, humanizing it, making you sympathize with it, until you feel sad for its very existence—not for the sake of the Earth, mind you, but for the sake of the pollutant itself. It&#39;s a new twist on the old message of vampire books and ancient mythology. Being immortal—or, in this case, non-biodegradable—really kind of sucks.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/YDBtCb61Sd4?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></iframe></p>\n<p>BONUS! Of course you finish up your best of the year list and then something pops up at the last minute and warrants inclusion. So here&#39;s number eleven on my top ten list. &quot;Dueling Cameras&quot; by Adam Lisagor and Noah Kalina, skating in at the end of the year. Adam wrote about the video, &quot;halfway through [production], I realized that it&#39;d been the first time in a long while I&#39;d made something just for the hell of it. And I remembered how good that feels.&quot; That seems like a pretty good place to end. And also a sentiment that sums up the spirit behind everything on this list. Happy New Year, everyone!</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D18026253%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D0%26show_byline%3D0%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D00ADEF%26fullscreen%3D1%26autoplay%3D0%26loop%3D0&amp;width=640&amp;height=360\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/18026253\">Dueling Cameras</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/lonelysandwich\">lonelysandwich</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p><br><br>\n<i><a href=\"http://spiegelman.tumblr.com/\">Eric Spiegelman</a> is a proprietor of <a href=\"http://oldjewstellingjokes.com/\">Old Jews Telling Jokes</a>.</i></p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.theawl.com/2011/01/the-10-most-wonderful-internet-films-of-2010#comments\">5 Comments</a><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?a=dHx0UIoe-ko:ov5IlffHdp0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?a=dHx0UIoe-ko:ov5IlffHdp0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?i=dHx0UIoe-ko:ov5IlffHdp0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?a=dHx0UIoe-ko:ov5IlffHdp0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?i=dHx0UIoe-ko:ov5IlffHdp0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?a=dHx0UIoe-ko:ov5IlffHdp0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?a=dHx0UIoe-ko:ov5IlffHdp0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?i=dHx0UIoe-ko:ov5IlffHdp0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAwl/~4/dHx0UIoe-ko\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></p></p></p></p>"

But <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/travel/explorene/massachusetts/regions/capecod/articles/2008/02/24/after_alices_restaurants/\">Alice</a> doesn't live in the restaurant, she lives in the <a href=\"http://www.learningfromlyrics.org/alice.html\">church nearby the restaurant</a>, in the <a href=\"http://www.panoramio.com/photo/8900764\">bell tower</a>, with her husband Ray and <a href=\"http://www.arlo.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=13651\">Fasha the dog</a>. And living in the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/61897811@N00/1306325104/\">bell tower</a> like that, they got a lot of <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0105-03.htm\">room downstairs where the pews used to be in</a>.  Having all that room, seeing as how they took out all the pews, they decided that they didn't have to take out their garbage for a long time.<br>\n<br>\nWe got up there, we found all the garbage in there, and we decided it'd be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the <a href=\"http://www.townofgb.org/Pages/GBarringtonMA_Recycling/index\">city dump</a>. So we took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,471467,00.html\">red VW microbus</a>, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the city dump.<br>\n<br>\nWell, we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across across the dump saying, \"<a href=\"http://www.learningfromlyrics.org/alice_files/image002.jpg\">Closed on Thanksgiving</a>.\" And we had never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in our eyes we drove off into the sunset looking for another place to put the garbage.<br>\n<br>\nWe didn't find one. Until we came to <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=prospect+st+great+barrington+MA+&amp;sll=42.367466,-73.634697&amp;sspn=1.01465,1.551819&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Prospect+St,+Great+Barrington,+Berkshire,+Massachusetts+01230&amp;ll=42.197256,-73.36951&amp;spn=0.007948,0.012124&amp;t=h&amp;z=16\">a side road</a>, and off the side of the side road there was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the cliff there was another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile was better than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we decided to throw ours down.<br>\n<br>\nThat's what we did, and drove <a href=\"http://www.guthriecenter.org/\">back to the church</a>, had <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=0VIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;ots=_N0XeL35fz&amp;dq=%22ray%20brock%22%20%22arlo%20guthrie%22&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat</a>, went to sleep and didn't get up until the next morning, when we got a phone call from <a href=\"http://www.arlo.net/obie.shtml\">Officer Obie</a>.  <br>\n<br>\nHe said, \"Kid,we found <a href=\"http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2010/07/11/if-i-had-hammer-wapo-hippie-columnist-would-pummel-gop-folk-singer\">your name on an envelope</a> at the bottom of a half a ton of garbage, and just wanted to know if you had any information about it.\" And I said, \"Yes, sir, <a href=\"http://sipseystreetirregulars.blogspot.com/2009/08/typical-case-of-american-blind-justice.html\">Officer Obie</a>, I cannot tell a lie, I put that envelope under that garbage.\"<br>\n<br>\nAfter speaking to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Obanhein\">Obie</a> for about forty-five minutes on the telephone we finally arrived at the truth of the matter and said that we had to go down and pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and speak to him at the police officer's station.  So we got in the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/akma/4022174359/\">red VW microbus</a> with the<br>\nshovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the police officer's station.<br>\n<br>\nNow friends, there was only one or two things that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/obituaries/william-j-obanhein-alice-s-restaurant-lawman-69.html\">Obie</a> coulda done at the police station, and the first was he could have given us a medal for being so brave and honest on the telephone, which wasn't very likely, and we didn't expect it, and the other thing was he could have bawled us out and told us never to be see driving garbage around the vicinity again, which is what we expected, but when we got to the police officer's station there was a third possibility that we hadn't even counted upon, and we was both immediately arrested.  Handcuffed.  And I said \"Obie, I don't think I can pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on.\"  He said, \"Shut up, kid. Get in the back of the patrol car.\" And that's what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car and drove to the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/17/AR2006111700448.html\">quote Scene of the Crime unquote</a>.<br>\n<br>\nI want tell you about the town of <a href=\"http://www.stockbridgechamber.org/\">Stockbridge, Massachusets</a>, where this happened here,<a href=\"http://stockbridgepolice.com/\">they got three stop signs, two police officers, and one police car</a>, but when we got to the Scene of the Crime there was five police officers and three police cars, being the biggest crime of the last fifty years, and everybody wanted to get in the <a href=\"http://www.thescreamonline.com/music/music5-1/arlo.html\">newspaper story about it</a>. And they was using up all kinds of cop equipment that they had hanging around the police officer's station. They was taking <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/impression-evidence2.htm\">plaster tire tracks</a>, <a href=\"http://www.crime-scene-investigator.net/footwear.html\">foot prints</a>, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1913987,00.html\">dog smelling prints</a>, and they took twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us.  Took pictures of the approach, the getaway, the northwest corner the southwest corner and that's not to mention the <a href=\"http://www.landsat.com/stockbridge-massachusetts-aerial-p607749.html\">aerial photography</a>.<br>\n<br>\nAfter the ordeal, we went back to the jail.  Obie said he was going to put us in the <a href=\"http://www.arlo.net/pictures/alices/arlo5.JPG\">cell</a>.  Said, \"Kid, I'm going to put you in the cell, I want your wallet and your belt.\"  And I said, \"Obie, I can understand you wanting my wallet so I don't have any money to spend in the cell, but what do you want my belt for?\"  And he said, \"Kid, we don't want any hangings.\"  I said, \"Obie, did you think I was going to hang myself for littering?\" Obie said he was making sure, and friends Obie was, cause he took out the toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself over the head and drown, and he took out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend the bars roll out the - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5mPc3UXu3w\">roll the toilet paper out the window, slide down the roll and have an escape</a>.  <br>\n<br>\nObie was making sure, and it was about four or five hours later that <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901591,00.html\">Alice</a> (remember <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16357141\">Alice</a>? It's a song about <a href=\"http://jamarattigan.livejournal.com/351910.html\">Alice</a>) Alice came by and with a few nasty words to Obie on the side, bailed us out of jail, and we went <a href=\"http://www.speechwriting.com/lauralee/trinity%20trivia.htm\">back to the church</a>, had a <a href=\"http://hubpages.com/hub/alices-restaurant\">another Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat</a>,and didn't get up until the next morning, when we all had to go to <a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/courts/courtsandjudges/courts/southberkshiredistrictmain.html\">court</a>.<br>\n<br>\nWe walked in, sat down, Obie came in with the twenty-seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, sat down.  Man came in said, \"All rise.\"  We all stood up, and Obie stood up with the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/volchok7/3189577778/\">twenty-seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures</a>, and the judge walked in sat down with a <a href=\"http://www.seeingeye.org/\">seeing eye dog</a>, and he sat down. We sat down. Obie looked at the seeing eye dog, and then at the twenty-seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, and looked at the seeing eye dog. And then at the twenty-seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one and began to cry, 'cause Obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of American <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_justice_(concept)#Blindfold\">blind justice</a>, and there wasn't nothing he could do about it, and the judge wasn't going to look at the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us.  <br>\n<br>\nAnd we was fined $50 and had to pick up the garbage in the snow, but thats not what I came to tell you about.<br>\n<br>\nI came to talk about <a href=\"http://www.sss.gov/lotter1.htm\">the draft</a>.<br>\n<br>\nThey got a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/realestate/10scapes.html\">building down New York City</a>, it's called <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D91E30F936A35750C0A963958260l\">Whitehall</a> <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/08/01/2004-08-01_where_recruits_no_longer_fee.html\"> Street</a>, where you <a href=\"http://www.landscaper.net/images/drftnote.gif\">walk in</a>, you get injected, <a href=\"http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/dumlao/MDST361/images/0024.jpg\">inspected</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comnet.ca/~pballan/C7P1.htm\">detected</a>, infected, neglected and <a href=\"http://www.vietnamwardraftlottery.com/phpnuke/index.php\">selected</a>.  I went down to get my <a href=\"http://www.landscaper.net/images/physnote.gif\">physical examination</a> one day, and I walked in, I sat down, <a href=\"http://bluematter.blogspot.com/2009/11/dodging-vietnam-draft.html\">got good and drunk the night before</a>, so I looked and felt my best when I went in that morning. `Cause I wanted to look like the all-American kid from New York City, man I wanted, I wanted to feel like the all-, I wanted to be the all American kid from New York, and I walked in, sat down, I was hung down, brung down, hung up, and all kinds o' mean nasty ugly things. And I waked in and sat down and they gave me a piece of paper, said, \"Kid, see the <a href=\"http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/combatphsych/section1_7.htm\">psychiatrist</a>, room 604.\"<br>\n<br>\nAnd I went up there, I said, \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NzFJxX8yoY\">Shrink, I want to kill.

Proceeded through, and when I finally came to the see the last man, I walked in, walked in sat down after a whole big thing there, and I walked up and said, \"What do you want?\"  He said, \"Kid, we only got one question. Have you ever been arrested?\"<br>\n<br>\nAnd I proceeded to tell him the story of the <a href=\"http://www.illustratorworld.com/users/e/ec/echox/a1158.jpg\">Alice's Restaurant Massacre</a>, with full orchestration and five part harmony and stuff like that and all the phenomena,  and he stopped me right there and said, \"Kid, did you ever go to court?\"<br>\n<br>\nAnd I proceeded to tell him the story of the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and the paragraph on the back of each one, and he stopped me right there and said, \"Kid, I want you to go and sit down on that bench that says <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_waiver\">Group W</a> .... NOW, kid!!\"<br>\n<br>\nAnd I, I walked over to the, to the bench there, and there is, <a href=\"http://usmilitary.about.com/od/armyjoin/a/criminal.-u59.htm\">Group W's where they put you if you may not be moral enough to join the army after committing your special crime</a>, and there was all kinds of mean nasty ugly looking people on the bench there.  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/volchok7/3188645359/in/set-7215761240769424\">Mother rapers.

And the meanest, ugliest, nastiest one, the meanest father raper of them all, was coming over to me and he was mean and ugly and nasty and horrible and all kind of things and he sat down next to me and said, \"Kid, whad'ya get?\"  I said, \"I didn't get nothing, <a href=\"http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattle911/archives/186357.asp\">I had to pay $50</a> and pick up the garbage.\" He said, \"What were you arrested for, kid?\" And I said, <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/06/14/state_laws_are_tough_on_littering_but_they_are_rarely_enforced/\">\"Littering</a>.\"  And they all moved away from me on the bench there, and the <a href=\"http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/hairy-eyeball.html\">hairy eyeball</a> and all kinds of mean nasty things, till I said, \"<a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2007/06/arlo_guthrie_is.html\">And creating a nuisance</a>.\"  And they all came back, shook my hand,and we had a great time on the bench, talkin about crime, mother stabbing, father raping, all kinds of groovy things that we was talking about on the bench.  And everything was fine, we was smoking cigarettes and all kinds of things, until the Sergeant came over, had some paper in his hand, held it up and said.<br>\n<br>\n\"Kids, <a href=\"http://delawarenationalguard.com/join/army/warrant/pdf/Moral%20Waiver.pdf\">this-piece-of-paper's-got-47-words-37-sentences-58-words-we-wanna-know-details-of-the crime-time-of-the-crime-and-any-other-kind-of-thing- you-gotta-say-pertaining-to-and-about-the-crime-I-want-to-know-arresting-officer's-name-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say</a>\", and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/volchok7/3189470666/in/set-72157612407694247/\">talked for forty-five minutes and nobody understood a word that he said</a>, but we had fun <a href=\"http://www.usarec.army.mil/hq/warrant/WO_moral_waiver.html\">filling out the forms</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/volchok7/3188631435/in/set-72157612407694247/\">playing with the pencils on the bench there</a>, and I filled out the massacre with the <a href=\"http://www.americanprofile.com/article/2896.html\">four part harmony</a>, and wrote it down there, just like it was, and everything was fine and I put down the pencil, and I turned over the piece of paper, and there, there on the other side, in the middle of the other side, away from everything else on the other side, in parentheses, capital letters, quotated, read thefollowing words:<br>\n<br>\n(\"KID, HAVE YOU REHABILITATED YOURSELF?\")<br>\n<br>\nI went over to the sergeant, said, \"Sergeant, you got a lot a damn gall to  ask me if I've rehabilitated myself.

Weighing in at around the same a sheet of card, and just about as thin, the iBend gains rigidity when it is bent into a curve.</p>\n<p>The plastic iBendXL (the smaller iBend is for the iPhone) sips flat. You pull it out and bend it, producing two hooks at the front which grab the bottom edge of the iPad and a gentle curve at the back which creates a flat rest for the iPad to lean on. It reminds me of the fascinating models and diagrams in my old math classroom which showed variously truncated cones, cut by flat planes at different angles.</p>\n<p>The iBendXL costs $10, and the smaller iBend is $5. Both are slim enough to be slipped betwixt the iDevice and whatever case contains it, and should be tough enough to last a good long time. What this stand really suggest, though, is a DIY project. I doubt the iBend folks are going to put up a printable PDF template anytime soon, but a rainy afternoon spent with some scissors, card and a French curve should get you pretty close. Available now, in plain colors or in fancy arted-up designs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myibend.com/\">iBend product page</a> [iBend.

Sure, there are days when I drop off of Twitter, etc. but I have not done any yet where I completely unplug. Perhaps, it is because I have been thinking of it in terms of a week, or even a weekend.

      "content" : "<p>If you pay attention to video game news, you’ve probably heard a lot of buzz these last few weeks about an indie game called <a href=\"http://www.minecraft.net/\"><cite>Minecraft</cite></a>. Ever since it caught the attention of gaming tastemakers <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/14/minecraft-mine-the-gap-day-1/\">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a> and <a href=\"http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/9/17/\">Penny Arcade</a>, my online social circle has been <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23minecraft\">completely twitterpated</a>. In fact, it has become so extraordinarily popular that the developers have made it temporarily free-to-play in order to prevent overloading their servers.</p>\n<p><cite>Minecraft</cite> is a peculiar game that’s difficult to classify. Its pedigree certainly includes the world-building of <cite>Dwarf Fortress</cite>, the procedural dungeon crawling of <cite>Rogue</cite>, and the undirected creativity of LEGO. While it’s marvellously simple and intuitive, <cite>Minecraft</cite> is not an easy game to learn. In its current alpha release, it has nothing in the way of guidance or tutorials. It’s nearly impossible to figure out what to do on your own, making it necessary to follow an external FAQ.</p>\n<p>In an effort to help resolve this unfortunate situation, I’ve put together a small guide to surviving your first day and night in <cite>Minecraft</cite>. There are already a number of excellent walkthroughs for new players available on the game’s forum, and my advice certainly does not diverge strongly from them. However, if this guide manages to pique your interest then I strongly encourage you to purchase a copy and explore the world of <cite>Minecraft</cite> for yourself.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/01_welcome.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"></p>\n<p>Welcome to your very own procedurally generated world! It’s very pretty and ripe for exploration. However, you shouldn’t start wandering just yet. When nighttime falls, the land will be crawling with all sorts of dangerous fiends. You need to start gathering the necessary materials to survive the night.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/02_lumber.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"></p>\n<p>The first resource you need is lumber. Walk up the nearest tree trunk and begin harvesting it by holding down the left mouse button. The block will eventually break, dropping a log that you can pick up. Chop down a few more trees in this manner until you have collected close to a dozen logs.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/03_crafting.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"></p>\n<p>To begin using these logs, they need to be crafted into lumber and sticks. Begin by pressing ‘i’ to open your inventory, then click and drag the logs into the crafting window. You will receive four units of lumber for each log you process. Next, drag the lumber into the crafting window in the shape illustrated above (one on top of the other) to create sticks. If necessary, you can split your lumber pile in half by right clicking it.</p>\n<p>Crafting is one of the <cite>Minecraft</cite>‘s most fundamental mechanics, but in the alpha version it is very poorly documented. If you’d like to know more about the sort of things you can craft, I recommend consulting the <a href=\"http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Crafting\">Minecraft Wiki</a>.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/04_coal.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"></p>\n<p>Coal is the second essential resource for your first night in <cite>Minecraft</cite>. As illustrated in the screenshot above, it looks like black splotches on a rock cube. It’s most commonly found embedded in sheer rock cliffs and natural cave formations. However, unlike wood, you cannot gather coal with your bare hands; you need to craft a proper tool.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/05_equipment.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"></p>\n<p>To make a tool, you need a crafting table to access the 3×3 crafting grid. You can make one by arranging four pieces of lumber in a square. Move the crafting table to the bottom line of your inventory, use the scroll wheel to equip it, and place it in the world by right clicking. Don’t worry too much about the position, as you can pick the crafting table back up by left-click “gathering” it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/06_mining.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"></p>\n<p>Right click the crafting table to access the larger grid, then place your lumber and sticks in the above formation. This will create a wooden pickaxe, a valuable mining tool that tears through rock and harvests certain ores. Equip it (the same way you did the crafting table) and hold the left mouse button to mine the coal. You should also gather some rock while you’re at it, though it’s plentiful everywhere.</p>\n<p>While pickaxes are fundamental to progressing in <cite>Minecraft</cite>, it’s worth noting that you can also craft axes, shovels and hoes to speed up your work or swords and armour to protect yourself.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/07_night.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"></p>\n<p>By the time you’ve finished gathering coal, it’s quite likely that the sun has begun to set. Zombies, spiders and skeletons will begin wandering the land shortly, and you’re in no shape to fight them with your current equipment. It’s therefore imperative that you construct some shelter to hide in. Fortunately, all the materials you’ve been gathering will help you to do exactly that. Use your pickaxe to carve a shallow cave in the side of a cliff. Any location will do, but I advise not wandering too far from your starting point (you’ll respawn there when you die). For extra safety, wall up the entrance with dirt when you’re finished.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/08_cave.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"></p>\n<p>Of course, noone wants to sit around in a dark cave all night. To get things done, you’ll need some light. Combine sticks and coal to craft some torches, then place them on the walls to light up the room. Monsters won’t spawn in lighted areas, so you should place a few outside your abode as well.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/09_furniture.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"><br><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/10_furniture.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"></p>\n<p>Since you’re stuck inside until the sun rises, you might as well get some crafting done. I recommend constructing two particularly useful pieces of furniture. A furnace is made out of rock and consumes fuel (wood or coal) to smelt ore, bake bricks and cook food. A wooden chest provides an abundance of extra storage space. It’s a great place to keep your more valuable items, as it will protect you from losing them when your character dies.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/11_digging.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"></p>\n<p>If it’s still dark outside, you should start digging a mine and exploring the underworld. You can find rare and valuable ores as you descend, but you’ll need a better tool to gather them. For now, crafting a pick out of rock will allow you to collect iron. Resist the temptation to dig straight down; you might get stuck or fall into lava. Instead, dig diagonally in a descending staircase shape. If you hit a natural underground cave or dungeon, be sure to explore it (cautiously!)</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/12_iron.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"></p>\n<p>Similarly to coal, iron ore appears as tawny patches on rock. Smelting the ore into ingots with your furnace will allow you to craft iron armour, minecarts, buckets, etc. Iron is a very useful metal, but as you dig deeper you’ll find precious gold, diamond and redstone.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/13_zombie.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Minecraft\"></p>\n<p>When dawn finally arrives, the morning sun will burn any monsters that are still roaming about (except for explosive <a href=\"http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Mob#Creepers\">Creepers</a>, inexplicably). The land is once again safe to explore, so I recommend taking advantage of the daylight to gather more lumber, hunt wild animals or embellish your residence (<a href=\"http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/14_mycave.png\">here’s mine at the moment</a>).</p>\n<p>Once you’ve gotten the basic mechanics down, how you continue to play is really up to you. You could try <a href=\"http://yfrog.com/n4v0bp\">spelunking the depths of the earth</a>, <a href=\"http://lunaran.com/pics/minecraft_treehouse.jpg\">building a treehouse</a> or <a href=\"http://towardsdawns.blogspot.com/\">sailing to distant lands</a>. There are no explicit goals or directives, just a wonderful sandbox of pure undirected play. I hope you have a grand adventure!</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/quixotic-engineer?a=BHkh87nVm1c:U30r1xtTPYo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/quixotic-engineer?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

      "content" : "<p>I didn’t really think the world of advertising was all that fascinating — until I started watching <em>Mad Men</em> a few years ago.  Now I can’t get enough.  That’s why I was thrilled to stumble upon a documentary that premiered at last year’s Sundance Film Festival called <em>Art &amp; Copy</em>.  It features really illuminating, no-holds-barred interviews with a lot of people who today are considered the pioneers of modern advertising, and who came of age in the <em>Mad Men</em> era.  People like George Lois, the loud-mouthed and brilliant guy who came up with Volkswagen’s legendary “Think Small” campaign.  And the guys who came up with “Got Milk?” — which everyone thought was a dumb idea, until someone realized it was brilliant.  And the guys who did “Where’s the Beef?” — which the client almost killed a week before it aired, and went on to become one of the most remembered and loved commercials of the past thirty years.  </p>\n<p>It’s also a fascinating look at how much advertising has changed since the sixties and seventies.  Back then, city-dwellers saw an average of about 1,000 ads a day.  Now it’s more like 5,000.  Isn’t that insane?  That’s why 65% of Americans say that they feel “constantly bombarded by advertisements.”  Which speaks to another point that <em>Art &amp; Copy</em> and its interviewees argue rather well — which is that, yes, there are plenty of crappy ads out there, that are offensive and stupid and appeal to the lowest common denominator, but when advertising really works, when it really does all it can do, it rises above crass commercialism and becomes a work of art.  You know those Toulouse-Lautrec prints you see all over the place these days?  A lot of those were posters he made — advertisements that were printed and pasted around Paris, to try and induce people to come to certain cafes and bars and pay the cover charge.  They were ads, and now they’re art.  So where do you draw the line?</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/hLfvmiB4edI?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US%26rel%3D0&amp;width=570&amp;height=345\" width=\"570\" height=\"345\"></iframe></p>"

      "content" : "<p>Minimal Mac recently rounded the corner of it’s first year in existence. I think I can safely say that everything about it has exceeded my expectations, mostly because I really had none at the start. I thought I would come up with this little project that a few people might enjoy that discussed the merits of having “enough” when it came to technology and, with extrapolation, life. <a href=\"http://patrickrhone.com/2009/08/05/the-24-hour-idea/\">It went from that thought to execution in 24 hours</a>. Here we are, almost 900 posts later, still doing this thing. I won’t discuss the numbers but, let me suffice to say that more than a few of you show up every day to see what I post and, as a writer and curator, it makes me equal parts humbled and proud.</p>\n<p>I hope the coming year will bring even more of the same, yet <a href=\"http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/48588149/better\">better</a>. I want to continue to make sure I am working every day to bring a level of quality to the work I produce here that is consistent with my beliefs and abilities. I want to make sure that the subject matter is both topical and rational. I also want to work hard to make sure that anyone who chooses to give me even a moment of their valuable time and attention walks away feeling it is a fair trade and square deal.</p>\n<p>I’m also hoping to spruce the place up a bit. Perhaps a fresh coat of greyscale paint. Make it look even better on those new fangled devices all the cool kids carry these days.</p>\n<p>I thought, especially for those that have not been here since the beginning, an appropriate way to celebrate would be for me to call out some of the posts I think are not only a good overview of the year that was, but are also a reflection of what we believe in:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://minimalmac.com/post/146660640/welcome\">Welcome</a> – The very first post.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://minimalmac.com/post/166561248/the-forgotten-cost-of-features\">The forgotten cost of features</a> – Wherein I use a simple piece of paper to explain that every feature has an often hidden associated cost.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://minimalmac.com/post/538353523/the-what-if-myth\">The “What if” Myth</a> – The lies we use to excuse ourselves from bad behavior.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://minimalmac.com/post/534911529/my-pledge-to-you\">My Pledge To You</a> – What Gizmodo did not learn as children.

I fixed it last night and was cleaning it up for release this morning, when I saw this on Twitter:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/PatinDetroit/status/20386950059\"><img src=\"http://waxy.org/random/images/weblog/memeorandum_update-20100805-104441.png\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/PatinDetroit/status/20387030016\"><img src=\"http://waxy.org/random/images/weblog/memeorandum_update_2-20100805-105138.png\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/PatinDetroit/status/20387076175\"><img src=\"http://waxy.org/random/images/weblog/memeorandum_update_3-20100805-105330.png\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I never looked at his site, so was totally unaware of his political leanings. I was just busy.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy the code, Pat!  Sorry I took so long to fix the code you use and love, for free, every day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Pat deleted his three tweets (archived above for posterity) and, in an <a href=\"http://waxy.org/random/images/weblog/patindetroit_twitter_archive.png\">epic 17-tweet rant</a>, offered me and five others &quot;an ass kicking that you will never, ever forget.&quot;  He follows up with a threat to sue me for publishing his &quot;likeness and words&quot; — screenshots of the three deleted tweets above, posted in public, addressed to me, and reproduced for non-commercial commentary and criticism under the Copyright Act&#39;s &quot;fair use&quot; provisions. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> And now his Twitter account's gone. I saved <a href=\"http://waxy.org/random/images/weblog/patindetroit_twitter_archive.png\">an archive</a> of his threatening tweets for posterity. If you want to get in touch, his new account is <a href=\"http://twitter.com/RightBloggerPat\">@RightBloggerPat</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>August 6:</strong> Pat wrote a <a href=\"http://www.politicalbyline.com/2010/08/06/fatty-this/\">followup on his blog</a>, with his perspective of the whole ordeal.  He admits he jumped the gun and apologizes for the mistake.  Case closed.</p> "

      "content" : "<p></p><p>In reading about the lives of history’s great men, one thing I’ve noticed is that many of them had a place they could go to be alone with their thoughts. Some of these men had a study where they would retreat to think, read, and write. Others had a garage or workshop where they would tinker and experiment. But what all these rooms had in common was their sheer manliness. They were <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/01/10/the-decline-of-male-space/\">man spaces</a>, places a man could call his own.</p>\n<p>Below we give you a look inside the man rooms of 14 famous men from history. Within these rooms they formulated ideas that would change the world, wrote books that remain classics, and revitalized the dynamic manliness that drove their success. While we all can’t have a Carnegie-esque study, perhaps you’ll find inspiration from these manly spaces to spruce up your own room or simply the push to find a place where you can get away from it all and in tune with your manliness.</p>\n<h3>Ernest Hemingway’s Writing Studio</h3>\n<p><img title=\"hemingway\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/hemingway2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"></p>\n<p>The room where <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/08/11/the-hemingway-you-didnt-know-papas-adventures/\">Papa</a> wrote <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls </em>and <em>Death in the Afternoon. </em><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/08/27/motivational-posters-ernest-hemingway-edition/\">Ernest Hemingway</a> lived in this house in Key West, Florida for more than 10 years. Needing a place where he could drink a glass of scotch, smoke a cigar, and write about men being men, Hemingway turned the old carriage house on the property into his personal writing studio. The main features in the room are the Cuban cigar-maker’s chair and his Royal typewriter. Throughout the room, Hemingway placed mementos he collected from his manly adventures in Africa and Cuba.</p>\n<h3>Theodore Roosevelt’s Trophy Room</h3>\n<p><img title=\"tr\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/tr.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"340\"></p>\n<p>After Theodore Roosevelt’s Dakota cattle business failed, he came back East to New York and built a home in Oyster Bay, NY. He called his estate Sagamore Hill, and he lived there until he died (with a stint in the White House, of course). It was where <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/05/17/theodore-roosevelt-motivational-posters/\">Roosevelt</a> would go to relax, romp in the woods, and revitalize his man spirit. The crowning manly jewel of the house was TR’s trophy room where he kept his collection of wild game he had hunted in Africa and throughout the American West. The room has a high ceiling and is filled with rich, dark Philippine camagon woodwork. A perfect place for the manliest president to read a book about <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/29/50-non-fiction-adventure-books/\">adventure in the grasslands </a>or to entertain guests and dignitaries.</p>\n<h3>Frederick Douglass’ Office</h3>\n<p><img title=\"doug\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/doug.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"298\" height=\"235\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img title=\"fred\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/fred1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"320\"></p>\n<p>Frederick Douglass was a true <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/12/28/self-made-men/\">self-made man</a>. He escaped from slavery and through hard work and self-education, became a writer, publisher, speaker and fierce abolitionist. With the money he made from writing and speaking, Douglass bought a 14 bedroom house in Washington, D.C. that he called Cedar Hill. His office was lined with over 1,000 books on a wide variety of subjects, and his walls were adorned with portraits of people he admired like Susan B. Anthony and Wendell Phillips. Douglas would spend up to five hours a day reading and writing in his manly study. At his sturdy wooden desk he penned many of his <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/07/11/manvotional-self-made-men-by-frederick-douglass/\">inspiring speeches </a>and his famous autobiography, <em>The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass.</em></p>\n<h3>Thomas Jefferson’s Study</h3>\n<p><img title=\"jefferson\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/jefferson.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"531\"></p>\n<p><img title=\"bedroom\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/bedroom1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\"></p>\n<p>The author of the Declaration of Independence also was a master architect. Jefferson designed the home that crowned his beautiful Monticello estate. Jefferson’s man space was his study where he’d read about, write about, and ponder liberty and other profound principles in solitude. The busts of great men served as muses for Jefferson. One of the unique aspects of Jefferson’s man space is how it’s connected to his bedroom. He placed his bed in an alcove in the wall between his study and room. That way Jefferson could roll right out of bed and start working or if he needed to take a power nap after hours of manly meditation and study, he could lie down for a respite.</p>\n<h3>Mark Twain’s Writing Hut</h3>\n<p><img title=\"twain2\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/twain2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"368\"></p>\n<p><img title=\"twain1\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/twain1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"215\"></p>\n<p>Mark Twain would often summer with his sister who lived in Elmira, New York. Needing a place where he could get some work done, Twain built himself a writing hut on his sister’s property. Free from distractions and inspired by the setting, Twain could write in peace and quiet. In this sanctuary of manliness, Twain wrote some of his most widely read and manly works: <em>Life on the Mississippi</em>, <em>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court</em>, and <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>.</p>\n<p>I love how Twain described his man space in an 1874 letter to William Dean Howells:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It is the loveliest study you ever saw…octagonal with a peaked  roof, each face filled with a spacious window…perched in complete  isolation on the top of an elevation that commands leagues of valley and  city and retreating ranges of distant blue hills. It is a cozy nest and  just room in it for a sofa, table, and three or four chairs, and when  the storms sweep down the remote valley and the lightning flashes behind  the hills beyond and the rain beats upon the roof over my head—imagine  the luxury of it.”</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Henry David Thoreau’s Cabin</h3>\n<p><img title=\"henry\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/henry.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"467\" height=\"350\"></p>\n<p>Tired of the distractions of modern living, Henry David Thoreau went to the woods to live a deliberate and simple life. He borrowed some land near a pond called Walden from friend Ralph Waldo Emerson and built himself a simple 10′x15′ shack. The inside was furnished with a bed, a table, a desk, and three chairs. That’s it. Total cost to build his man shack? $28.12. It was in this small hut in the woods that Thoreau would get the inspiration he needed to write his most famous work of Transcendental Philosophy, <em>Walden, Or Life in the Woods. </em>Thoreau’s rustic man-hut has inspired men for generations to tear out into the woods, build a shack with their own bare man hands, and start sucking the marrow out of life.</p>\n<h3>Thomas Edison’s Library</h3>\n<p><img title=\"edison\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/edison.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p><img title=\"ed001a\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/ed001a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"367\"></p>\n<p>Many people argue that Thomas Edison’s greatest contribution to science and technology was his Invention Factory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. This series of brick buildings was the first industrial research and development laboratory and is the model for today’s corporate and government R&amp;D labs. Nestled in the complex was Edison’s personal library. The focal point of the room is the roll top desk that Edison likely used to design cool stuff like the phonograph or <a title=\"Kinetoscope\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoscope\">Kinetoscope</a>. Edison knew how to <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/02/08/the-world-belongs-to-those-who-hustle/\">hustle</a> and would often work for 24 hours (or more!)  straight. He’d take catnaps in a cot that he set up in his library to recharge himself for more work.</p>\n<h3>John Muir’s Study</h3>\n<p><img title=\"john2\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/john2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></p>\n<p>When John Muir wasn’t wandering through Yosemite and pondering the awe-inspiring power of nature, he lived with his wife in a 14-room mansion in Martinez, California that had been built in 1883 by his father-in-law. The Muirs occupied that home from 1890 until John’s death in 1914. This was the most fruitful time of Muir’s career, and much of his productivity took place within the walls of his study, which he called his “scribble den.” Seated at his simple wooden desk, Muir laid much of the foundation for the modern conservation movement, penning hundreds of passionate magazine and newspaper articles and writing books on the importance of preserving nature, mulling over how to save the Hetch Hetchy Valley from being dammed, pushing for the creation of National Parks and a Park Service, and taking care of work for his job as the first president of the Sierra Club.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Winston Churchill’s Art Studio</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img title=\"churchillpainting_color\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/churchillpainting_color.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"240\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">In addition to being a first-class statesman, Winston Churchill was a talented artist as well. The man loved to paint. He loved it so much that he built himself an art studio in his estate’s garden. When he felt the “Black Dog” of depression tailing him, he would retreat to his studio and keep the darkness away by putting brush to canvas.</p>\n<h3>Mark Twain’s Billiards Room</h3>\n<p><img title=\"twain_house_billiard_room\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/twain_house_billiard_room.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"340\"></p>\n<p>Mark Twain is so manly that two of his man rooms made the list. This billiards room took up the entire top floor of his three-story Hartford, CT house where he lived from 1871-1891. The room was off limits to Twain’s wife and kids and reserved for Twain and his male guests to shoot pool, smoke cigars, and imbibe spirits. Twain also used the room as a man retreat, a place to write and hide from the domestic chaos on the other floors of the house. Twain explained the reason this special man space was needed in his home:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There ought to be a room in this house to swear in. It’s dangerous to have to repress an emotion like that…Under certain circumstances, profanity provides a relief denied even to prayer.”</p></blockquote>\n<h3>The Wright Brothers’ Bicycle Shop</h3>\n<h3><img title=\"Wright-Bicycle-Shop\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/Wright-Bicycle-Shop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"399\"></h3>\n<p>The garage or workshop is a favorite place for men to retreat to, drink a beer, and tinker on their car. The Wright brothers spent hours together in their bike shop fixing bikes and creating the first successful flying machine. Their shop actually changed locations several times, but what stayed the same was the industrial utility of the room and the solitude it offered them to ponder how to get man into the air.</p>\n<h3>Charles Darwin’s Study</h3>\n<h3><img title=\"darwin\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/darwin.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"></h3>\n<p><img title=\"charles\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/charles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"374\" height=\"464\"></p>\n<p>Located in rural Kent, England, Charles Darwin’s Down House is where the famous scientist lived and worked for over 40 years. Inside the home, Darwin had a private study where he would write in solitude. Darwin was a morning person and felt he did his best work between the hours of 8 AM and 9:30 AM. It was in this room that Darwin wrote his landmark work, <em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</em>. Darwin lined his shelves not only with books but also with animal specimens he found while taking walks in the afternoons. I’m totally digging that spiral cane and bowler hat placed on the chair in the first picture.</p>\n<h3>Frank Lloyd Wright’s Drafting Studio</h3>\n<p><img title=\"frank\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/frank1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"522\">Frank Lloyd Wright lived at his Oak Park, IL residence from 1889 until 1909. During these first two decades of his career, Wright developed his architectural practice and style, brainstorming ideas and drafting plans within the handsome home studio he designed himself. Under the octagonal hanging lights, Wright and his associates developed the Prairie style of architecture and designed 125 structures. The magnificent studio is certainly a worthy workplace for such a revered architect; a fellow architect said it offered “inspiration <em>everywhere</em>.”</p>\n<h3>Andrew Carnegie’s Study</h3>\n<p><img title=\"carnegie_study\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/carnegie_study1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"397\"></p>\n<p>Steele magnate Andrew Carnegie used some of his vast millions to build a 64-room mansion located on 5th Ave near Central Park in New York City. Among its 64 rooms were Carnegie’s private library and study where he would spend his mornings either alone or with his personal secretary. He used his library to receive applicants seeking a piece of his philanthropic treasure chest and his study to determine which ones would get funds. The rooms were decked out in typical Gilded Age furnishings- dark hand-carved wood, plush furniture, and decorative ceilings. Along the walls of both rooms were stenciled Carnegie’s favorite inspirational sayings like “The Kingdom of Heaven is within you.” It’s pretty amazing what sort of man room you can build when you’re the richest guy in the world.</p>\n<div style=\"overflow:hidden;width:1px;height:1px\">\n<h3>John Muir’s Study</h3>\n<p><img title=\"john2\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2010/07/john2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></p>\n</div>\nCheck Out These Related Posts:<ul><li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/12/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-13-declutter-your-life-and-make-some-extra-cash/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"June 12, 2009\">30 Days to a Better Man Day 13: Declutter Your Life</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/05/11/introducing-the-aom-library-of-random-man-knowledge/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"May 11, 2010\">Introducing The AoM Library of Random Man Knowledge</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/05/17/theodore-roosevelt-motivational-posters/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"May 17, 2009\">Motivational Posters: Theodore Roosevelt Edition</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/02/04/lessons-in-manliness-the-childhood-of-theodore-roosevelt/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"February 4, 2008\">Lessons in Manliness: The Childhood of Theodore Roosevelt</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/08/05/the-art-of-manliness-best-of-july-2009/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"August 5, 2009\">The Art of Manliness: Best of July 2009</a></li>\n</ul><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/f3iv4dtffn7nla1icg3h2et32g/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fartofmanliness.com%2F2010%2F07%2F27%2Ffamous-man-caves%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?a=GLd8e2k1_Cg:TPgJmOg2NLE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?a=GLd8e2k1_Cg:TPgJmOg2NLE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?i=GLd8e2k1_Cg:TPgJmOg2NLE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?a=GLd8e2k1_Cg:TPgJmOg2NLE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?i=GLd8e2k1_Cg:TPgJmOg2NLE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?a=GLd8e2k1_Cg:TPgJmOg2NLE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?i=GLd8e2k1_Cg:TPgJmOg2NLE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?a=GLd8e2k1_Cg:TPgJmOg2NLE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?i=GLd8e2k1_Cg:TPgJmOg2NLE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?a=GLd8e2k1_Cg:TPgJmOg2NLE:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/GLd8e2k1_Cg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

If you spend your life fucking people over, hurting those around you, eventually that will come back to you too.</p>\n<p>So as I’m sure you locals know my father flipped the fuck out. I’m not just talking about the flip the fuck out that my family and I were used to. I’m talking giant, public, flaming, news at 11 flip out. </p>\n<p>After the initial blitz of crap that came from it where nearly everyone I’ve ever known or worked with called or emailed or facebooked or whatever’d me died down I was left with some reflection. In a way it’s kind of like a giant release. Suddenly all those who wondered why I was always so weird around him, or why I didn’t seem to care for him understand or at least think they understand. </p>\n<p>Now, finally, the ties that bind, those that have been holding us, gagging us for years are severed and I can talk freely. We’ve spent decades being yelled down, manipulated, and abused into submission and damnit I don’t have to be quiet anymore. </p>\n<p>As I collect my thoughts more, as life settles into this new normal, which is not normal at all honestly, I plan on posting more. It’s cathartic, but most importantly if it helps just one person then it’s worth it. I know that out there there are thousands of women who are afraid. Women who don’t know what they will do to set him off next-  those who don’t believe they’re good enough because they’ve spent so long being told about all of their faults and all of the things that they do wrong. I know what it’s like to not know whether you’ll make it thru the night without yelling, praying that just one week will go by without a blow up, without the shit being thrown and the fists coming at you.  You are not alone, you can survive it, you can be stronger. </p>"

A few weeks later - much to his surprise - Todd received a charming reply in the mail, from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Watterson\">Bill Watterson</a> himself.  That letter can be seen below.<br>\n<br>\nTranscript follows. A visit to <a href=\"http://tlchurchphotography.com/blog/letter-from-bill-watterson-and-autograph-from-charles-shultz/\">Todd's blog</a> is advised, if only to catch a glimpse of the stunning envelope in which the response was sent.<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4820150213_f4dd87c95e_b.jpg\"><br>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-size:x-small\"><a href=\"http://tlchurchphotography.com/blog/letter-from-bill-watterson-and-autograph-from-charles-shultz/\">Source</a></span></div><br>\n<b>Transcript</b><br>\n<blockquote>Dear Todd,<br>\n<br>\nThank you for your letter. Here are some general comic strip cartooning tips that I've tried to make helpful for people at all levels of advancement. I hope these will apply to your work. <br>\n<br>\n1. Materials are not important, so long as your work reproduces and reduces clearly. It's what you do WITH the materials that counts. <br>\n<br>\n2. I think characters are more important than jokes. Any cartoonist ought to be able to come up with funny gags, but the best strips have rounded, complex characters that readers can care about. Cartoon characters should be more than standing props to deliver jokes. <br>\n<br>\n3. Don't imitate other strips. Editors are looking for something new and original. <br>\n<br>\n4. Most importantly, have fun with your work, and practice writing and drawing all you can. <br>\n<br>\nGood luck,<br>\n<br>\n(Signed, 'WB Watterson')<br>\n<br>\nW.B. Watterson</blockquote><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4701166441470224525-2292068118521528711?l=www.lettersofnote.com\" alt=\"\"></div>"

His expressive portraits are much like human portraits rather than snaps of dogs in their natural habitats. There is an emphasis on the traits of the particular kind of dog he is photographing almost as if he is trying to exaggerate what is already there. I can’t imagine what it is like to get that <em>one great shot</em>, especially with an animal who is far less cooperative than a human!</p>\n<p><span></span><img title=\"tim-flach-2\" src=\"http://dog-milk.com/images/2010/07/tim-flach-2.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Flach\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\"></p>\n<p><img title=\"tim-flach-3\" src=\"http://dog-milk.com/images/2010/07/tim-flach-3.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Flach\" width=\"500\" height=\"274\"></p>\n<p><img title=\"tim-flach-4\" src=\"http://dog-milk.com/images/2010/07/tim-flach-4.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Flach\" width=\"500\" height=\"658\"></p>\n<p>Am I wrong or does this guy kind of look like Ozzy Osbourne?</p>\n<p><img title=\"tim-flach-5\" src=\"http://dog-milk.com/images/2010/07/tim-flach-5.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Flach\" width=\"500\" height=\"251\"></p>\n<p>[via <a href=\"http://www.ignant.de/2010/07/08/tim-flach/\">Ignant</a>]</p>\n<hr>\n<small>© 2010 <a href=\"http://dog-milk.com\">Dog Milk</a> | Posted by Jaime in <a href=\"http://dog-milk.com/category/for-humans/\" title=\"View all posts in For Humans\" rel=\"category tag\">For Humans</a>,  <a href=\"http://dog-milk.com/category/other/\" title=\"View all posts in Other\" rel=\"category tag\">Other</a> | <a href=\"http://dog-milk.com/tim-flach/\">Permalink</a> | <a href=\"http://dog-milk.com/tim-flach/#comments\">5 comments</a> | <a title=\"Tweet This\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Currently%20reading%20Tim%20Flach%20on%20Dog%20Milk:%20http://dog-milk.com/tim-flach/\">Tweet This</a> | <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://dog-milk.com/tim-flach/&amp;title=Tim%20Flach\" title=\"Share this\non Facebook\">Share on Facebook</a></small>"

It&#39;s of a very different feel than the original. The Roots&#39; MC Black Thought and guitarist Kirk Douglas wear suits (!) as they handle Ren and Eazy-E&#39;s verses, respectively. And the avoidance of profanity is jarring. (Black Thought raps that he&#39;ll &quot;find a good piece of <em>mush</em>/And go up in it,&quot; which is far more offensive, actually, than the real word that goes there.) But still, as it&#39;s own thing, musically, like Questlove says at the end, Damn, that shit was dope.         </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://api.tweetmeme.com/share?url=http://www.theawl.com/2010/06/the-roots-and-ice-cube-straight-outta-compton\"><img src=\"http://api.tweetmeme.com/imagebutton.gif?url=http://www.theawl.com/2010/06/the-roots-and-ice-cube-straight-outta-compton\" height=\"61\" width=\"51\"></a></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?a=rayHlPpXxsc:vSzZclX8wC4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?a=rayHlPpXxsc:vSzZclX8wC4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?i=rayHlPpXxsc:vSzZclX8wC4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?a=rayHlPpXxsc:vSzZclX8wC4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?i=rayHlPpXxsc:vSzZclX8wC4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?a=rayHlPpXxsc:vSzZclX8wC4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?a=rayHlPpXxsc:vSzZclX8wC4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheAwl?i=rayHlPpXxsc:vSzZclX8wC4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAwl/~4/rayHlPpXxsc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Every time I see this movie I cry no matter what. It is quite touching. So, when <a href=\"http://www.wildflowersphotos.com/\">Wildlfowers Photography</a> shared with us this adorable engagement shoot we were so excited to share it with you!</p>\n<p>The idea of this photo shoot came from Lynnette and James.  Their favorite movie is <a href=\"http://www.weddingchicks.com/wedding-chicks/engagement-sessions/37401/disney-pixars-up-engagement-shoot/?preview=true&amp;preview_id=37401&amp;preview_nonce=d3c3a25bfa\">UP</a><em> </em>so they wanted an engagement shoot based around the movie. Below is a sweet and touching letter that James wrote  to Lynnette and so kindly shared with <a href=\"http://www.wildflowersphotos.com/\">Wildlfowers Photography</a> and we are going to share it with you… break out your hankies…</p>\n<p>“Lynnette… I have a confession, I am in love with you.  It is not the  ‘usual’ love, but the love that makes me remember the little things, the  ‘boring’ things.  It is the boring things in life that I will remember  the most.  The memories of jumping over sidewalk cracks to how the  clouds talk to us.  You make me remember the moments.  It is that love  that makes me believe.  Belief that I was there when you were a  toothless kid.  Dancing through life, only stopping to hold my hand.  Letting me know that anything is possible.  I am in love with you, ‘my  greatest adventure’. – James”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wildflowersphotos.com/\"><img title=\"wildflowers photography\" src=\"http://www.weddingchicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/wildflowers_photography.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"385\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wildflowersphotos.com/\"><img title=\"vintage engagement shoot\" src=\"http://www.weddingchicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/vintage_e_shoot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"367\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wildflowersphotos.com/\"><img title=\"ballon engagement shoot\" src=\"http://www.weddingchicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ballon_engagement_shoot1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"367\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wildflowersphotos.com/\"><img title=\"amazing engagement session\" src=\"http://www.weddingchicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/amazing_engagement_session.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"751\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wildflowersphotos.com/\"><img title=\"vintage inspired engagement shoot\" src=\"http://www.weddingchicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/vintage_inspired_e_shoot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"600\"></a></p>\n<p><img title=\"ballon engaement shoot\" src=\"http://www.weddingchicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ballon_engaement_shoot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"367\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wildflowersphotos.com/\"><img title=\"vw vintage bus\" src=\"http://www.weddingchicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/vw_vintage_bus.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"385\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wildflowersphotos.com/\"><img title=\"unique engagement shoot\" src=\"http://www.weddingchicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/unique_engagement_shoot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"364\"></a></p>\n<p>Photography: <a href=\"http://www.wildflowersphotos.com/\">Wildlfowers Photography</a></p>"

      "content" : "<p>It took both the telephone and the mobile phone 15 years to amass 100 million users, but Facebook did it in 9 months. We see more and more people becoming connected on online social networks, and it seems our networks are growing exponentially. But the reality is, social networks rarely add to our number of connections. We’ve already met almost all the people we’re connected to on social networks. We’re already connected to these people offline. Social networks simply make the connections visible. For example, we often connect with old school friends, and catch up over a couple of wall posts. But rarely do we continue the conversation once we’ve connected, and over time we forget that the connections exist. In fact, Facebook users often have no interactions with up to 50% of their connections.<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn1\">1</a></sup> When we study how people are interacting on social networks, we see that most interactions are with a very small subset of the people we’re connected to.</p>\n\n\t<p>The average number of friends on Facebook is 130, and many users have many more.<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn2\">2</a></sup> Yet despite having hundreds of friends, most people on Facebook only interact regularly with 4 to 7 people,<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn3\">3</a></sup> and for 90% of Facebook users, 20% of their friends account for 70% of all interactions.<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn4\">4</a></sup> We also see this with phone usage. We have hundreds of people in our phone contacts, yet 80% of phone calls are made to the same 4 people. We know dozens of people who use Skype, yet 80% of Skype calls are made to 2 people.<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn5\">5</a></sup> Even when people play computer games online, they mostly play with people they know offline.<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn6\">6</a></sup></p>\n\n\t<p>We also have varied interactions with the people we’re not as close to. We find out about new jobs, not through our friends, but through friends of friends. When our friends’ friends’ friends lose weight, we lose weight.<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn7\">7</a></sup> We go onto eBay and buy things for hundreds and thousands of dollars from people we’ve never met, and will probably never interact with again.</p>\n\n\t<p>We have many diverse relationships with the people in our lives, yet the web doesn’t support this very well.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/files/banda/designing-for-social/pauladams_fig1.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"289\" alt=\"the web doesn&#39;t support different layers of relationships very well\" title=\"\"></p>\n\t<p><i>On Facebook (left), all my “friends” are treated equally. I’m presented with a long alphabetical list. Some of these people I would trust with my deepest secrets, and there are others that I’ve met less than five times. Yet they are grouped together in a big bucket of “friends”. Of the people who are “friends” with me on Facebook, there are many that I wouldn’t call a “friend”. I may call them an acquaintance, or a colleague, or even a family member, but they’re not in the same category as my closest friends.</i></p>\n\n\t<p><i>In my phone (right), all my contacts are treated equally. I’m presented with a long alphabetical list. My best friend is given the same number of pixels as someone I haven’t spoken to in 5 years. I may be able to access my most frequently contacted people via a ‘Favorites’ tab, but these people are still presented in the same way as the people I’ve lost touch with. On LinkedIn (right), all my connections are treated equally. Yet I have worked with some of them every day for years, and there are others that I met once at a conference.</i></p>\n\n\t<p>Our social web tools must start to understand the strength of ties, that we have stronger relationships with some people than with others. And with this knowledge they need to adapt.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>There are three kinds of relationship ties:</b><br><ul><li>Strong ties: People we care deeply about.</li><li>Weak ties: People we are loosely connected to, like friends of friends.</li><li>Temporary ties: People we don’t know, and interact with temporarily.</li></ul></p>\n\n\t<p>Let’s look at each type of tie, and how we might design for them.</p>\n\n<h3>Most people have less than 10 strong ties</h3><br>For decades, people have talked about social networks being made up of strong and weak ties. Think of the people in your life. Think about your closest friends, the people you are closest to in your family. These are examples of your strong ties. Strong ties are the people you care about most. People often refer to strong ties as people in their “circle of trust”. Strong ties often wield the most influence over people’s decisions. <br>\n\t<p>Most people have very few strong ties, usually less than ten. A study of 3000 randomly chosen Americans showed that the average American has just four close social contacts (four strong ties). Most Americans have between two and six strong ties. People’s strong ties come from a variety of places. About half of the strong ties are said to be friends. The other half includes spouses, partners, parents, siblings, children, co-workers, fellow members of clubs, neighbors, and professional advisors and consultants.<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn8\">8</a></sup> In both 2002 and 2007, a study of 1,178 adults found that on average, people had about 10 friends they meet or speak with at least weekly (10 strong ties).<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn9\">9</a></sup> So, when we’re designing for strong ties, we’re designing for small groups of people.</p>\n\n\t<p>Some people believe that this is changing, that the web is making us closer to more people.<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn10\">10</a></sup> On the contrary, research studies have shown that the vast majority of usage on social networks is between strong ties. As we saw earlier, on Facebook it’s with 4 to 6 people, with phone calls its with 4 people, and with Skype it’s 2 people. When people play online computer games with others, they are mostly interacting and playing with people they know, often with people who live less than a few miles away. This pattern of technology being used for strong tie communication is not new. When the telephone was invented, it did more to expand and strengthen strong ties than to weaken them. A study in the 1970s showed that the majority of phone calls were to people who live within five miles of the caller’s home.<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn11\">11</a></sup></p>\n\n\t<p><b>When designing for strong ties:</b><br><ul><li>Think about their existing means of communication. Phone calls, text messages, email. Strong ties already have established ways to interact, we should support them, and not try and replace them with our own messaging systems.</li><li>Showing more information about the ten closest people is likely to be much more valuable than showing less information about many more people.</li><li>Avoid generic terms such as “Friends”. This will likely lead to over-populating groups and reducing their relevance.</li><li>Suggest connections to people, but communicate the effects of adding new connections.</li></ul></p>\n\n<h3>People have about 150 weak ties that they stay up-to-date with</h3><br>Moving away from your strongest ties, think about some of your friends’ friends. People you don’t know so well. These are examples of your weak ties. Weak ties are people you know, but care less about. These are the people that are loosely connected to you. Weak ties are people you wouldn’t feel uncomfortable stuck in a elevator with, yet don’t feel much emotional closeness to. <br>\n\t<p>In the 1970s, the sociologist Marc Granovetter wrote a seminal paper about the strength of weak ties. He concluded that weak ties are often a much better source of information than strong ties. As our strong ties are a very small circle, weak ties can be a more powerful source of information and advice. Studies show that most people can only stay up-to-date with 150 weak ties in real life. This pattern has been true for thousands of years. Neolithic villages tended  to separate into two once they reached 150 inhabitants, the Roman army was split into groups of 150, so that everyone knew each other.<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn12\">12</a></sup> It is still true today, online and offline. We are connected to many more than 150 weak ties, but don’t stay in touch with them. We may be connected to hundreds of people on Facebook, but we would struggle to tell anyone what is going on in all of their lives.</p>\n\n\t<p>In social networks, weak ties can sometimes be very useful, for example, connections on LinkedIn can help you find a new job, a friend of a friend can give you advice on a specific topic. Yet sometimes, weak ties on social networks can lead to awkward social situations, for example, receiving unwanted Facebook invites from people you don’t know very well.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>When designing for weak ties:</b><br><ul><li>Consider the trade-off between communication and trust. Weak ties may be more knowledgeable about something we’re interested in, but we may trust them less. It may be important to show our other shared ties, or expose their sources of knowledge, so that we can increase the trust between people.</li><li>Make it easy for people to expose their networks to people they trust with that data. This will open up links between weak ties, without compromising user privacy.</li><li>Enable appropriate communication channels between weak ties. It may be better to go through, or highlight, a shared strong tie.</li></ul></p>\n\n<h3>The web is increasing our interactions with temporary ties</h3><br>Strong and weak ties are not enough when we think of relationships online. We need a new category of tie – the temporary tie. <br>\n\t<p>Temporary ties have always existed, but the web is bringing them to the fore. Think about some people you’ve only interacted with once. You don’t actually know who they are. A store assistant, a call center employee, the person you bought from on eBay. These are examples of your temporary ties. Temporary ties are much more common online than offline. They are people that you have no recognized relationship with, but temporarily interact with for a specific reason. Once the task has been completed, temporary ties are unlikely to interact again. You don’t know these people beyond the words they typed, and whatever online profile they have. With the rise of online user generated content, temporary ties are becoming more important.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Following are four common types of temporary ties:</b><br><ol><li>People sometimes interact with temporary ties around an <b>information need</b>. People needing information seek people with knowledge of the answer. Once the request for information has been fulfilled, interaction with these ties usually ceases. You may ask a person in the street for directions, or online you may seek information from people on Yahoo! Answers. This type of temporary tie is increasingly important for the future of web search. People are looking to other people, rather than businesses, to answer certain queries.</li></ol></p>\n\n<li>Temporary ties also exist when people need to temporarily interact to <b>complete a task</b>. Once the task is completed, interaction ceases. For example, interacting with a sales assistant in a shop, or having a plumber in your house to fix a leaking pipe. Many of these tasks are now online, for example interacting with a call center representative to arrange cable installation, or buying something from a temporary tie on eBay.</li>\n<li>Temporary ties can form around a <b>shared ongoing interest</b> such as a sports team or hobby. Interaction can often happen on a community website, for example a sports team forum. The true identity of these ties can remain unknown. One some of these sites, frequent posters start to recognise each other and each other’s behaviour. Although they likely have never met, their relationship can move from temporary tie to weak tie. There are an increasing number of examples where temporary ties interact online, and meet offline.</li>\n<li>People often form temporary ties with people sharing the same physical space. These ties can be as simple as a 1 minute conversation on the street, or as complex as an intermittent 3 day conversation at a music festival. Technology now allows us to communicate with temporary ties who shared the same physical space with us, albeit not at the same time. We can use our phones to see who has previously been to the restaurant we’re considering, what they ordered, and whether they thought it was any good.</li><br>Because we have no relationship history with our temporary ties (unlike with our strong and weak ties), representing identity and reputation are critical for successful interactions. We need to know that the eBay seller is trustworthy. We need to know that the medical advice we’re reading is from an actual doctor, and not someone pretending that they are a doctor. We need to know that the restaurant review is from someone who knows about food, and that the Amazon review wasn’t written by a company employee.<br>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/files/banda/designing-for-social/pauladams_fig2.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"187\" alt=\"reputation building\" title=\"\"></p><i>On Yahoo Answers, people can build their reputation in different ways. On the left, “Messykat” is building her reputation by trying to provide the best answers to questions. She may be helpful in 20% of cases, but we still don’t know much about her credentials as an expert in any of her 3 specialty areas (Cats, Dogs, Weddings). On the right, “RuthAnn” is trying to build her reputation by stating that she “has been training dogs for 40 years”. This only adds a superficial layer of credibility, as we can’t verify if it is true.</i><br>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/files/banda/designing-for-social/pauladams_fig3.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"214\" alt=\"building trust by positive feedback from temporary ties\" title=\"\"></p><i>On eBay (left), “jmjenkins” is building trust by getting positive feedback from temporary ties who have dealt with him in the past. Some of these people have also left positive comments on his profile, e.g. “Item just as described, arrived safe and sound. Thanks! A++”.</i><br>\n\t<p><i>On Amazon (right), “W.Todd Dominey” is building his reputation by providing helpful reviews in 665 of 711 cases. He is also building trust by using his real name, and sharing where he is from. However, as with “RuthAnn” on Yahoo Answers, we don’t know how much “W.Todd Dominey” knows about the topic being reviewed. We can’t verify his credentials.</i></p>\n\n\t<p>The motivation for most people who help their temporary ties is not monetary. You can’t create a great temporary tie community with financial reward. Yelp tried to do this by paying people $1 per review, and later they tried to build communities by paying people $15 an hour to comment on existing reviews and write new ones. Yelp ended up with a lot of poor quality reviews <sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn13\">13</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn14\">14</a></sup>, and a lot of bad press. Some of the <i>actual</i> motivations for temporary ties include recognition of being an expert, altruism, and feeling that they belong to a community. All of these behaviors need to be understood and accounted for in our social web designs.</p>\n\n\t<p>Supporting temporary ties is good for business. One study showed evidence that “an increase in positive comments about a mobile handset typically appeared a month or two before an increase in market share for that handset.”<sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn15\">15</a></sup> Another study over 7 months showed that when the online promoter activity (an estimate of the online chatter likely to lead to a recommendation) went up, sales went up the following month. When activity went down, sales went down. <sup><a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/#fn16\">16</a></sup></p>\n\n\t<p><b>When designing for temporary ties:</b><br><ul><li>Prioritize a great system for building reputation. Allow people to give feedback to one another.</li><li>Encourage people to expose content that will increase trust in their identity. This could be their real name, a real photo rather than an avatar, or proof of their qualifications.</li><li>Prioritize a great system for building trust between people. This may be highlighting shared connections, shared groups, or shared interests.</li><li>Don’t incentivize people with money, incentivize them to build their reputation.</li></ul></p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3><br>Social web design will become an important part of every interaction designer’s skillset. To do it well, we’ll need to understand some basics about human relationships. If your users’ needs center around strong ties, you’ll design something very different than if they center around temporary ties. Understanding the difference between strong, weak, and temporary ties will help us build better online social experiences.<br><br>\n<h3>References</h3><br><p><sup>1, 4</sup> <a href=\"http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~alessandra/papers/interaction-eurosys09.pdf\">User Interactions in Social Networks and their Implications, Wilson et al. 2009</a> </p><p><sup>2</sup> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics\">http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics</a> </p><p><sup>3</sup> <a href=\"http://www.insidefacebook.com/2009/02/27/facebooks-in-house-sociologist-shares-stats-on-users-social-behavior/\">The Economist article quoting stats from Cameron Marlow, sociologist at Facebook</a> </p><p><sup>5</sup> <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/stefana_broadbent_how_the_internet_enables_intimacy.html\">Data from a <span>TED</span> talk by researcher Stefana Broadbent</a></p><p><sup>6</sup> <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/impact/myths.html\"><span>PBS</span> article by Henry Jenkins, <span>MIT</span> Professor</a> </p><p><sup>7, 8</sup> Nichola Christakis + James Fowler <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Connected-Surprising-Power-Social-Networks/dp/0316036145\">“Connected: The surprising power of our social networks and how they shape our lives”</a> Little, Brown and Company 2009</p><p><sup>9</sup> <a href=\"http://www.digitalcenter.org/pages/site_content.asp?intGlobalId=20\">Reports from the Center for the Digital Future, University of Southern California</a></p><p><sup>10</sup> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/magazine/07awareness-t.html?_r=3&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin\">Brave New World of Digital Intimacy </a></p><p><sup>11</sup> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Social-Impact-Telephone-Bicentennial-studies/dp/0262160668\">I. de Sola Pool, The Social Impact of the Telephone, <span>MIT</span> Press, 1977</a></p><p><sup>12</sup> <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/buddy_brain_drain_n03pXeF8wGS5EEfCEOtKoI\">Quoted from studies by Robin Dunbar</a></p><p><sup>13</sup> <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/blogspotting/archives/2006/12/paying_people_t.html\">Paying People to Yelp</a></p><p><sup>14</sup> <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2006/tc20061207_915943.htm?chan=technology_technology+index+page_today&#39;s+top+stories\">Yelping for Dollars</a></p><p><sup>15, 16</sup> Charlene Li + Josh Bernoff, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Groundswell-Winning-Transformed-Social-Technologies/dp/1422125009\">Groundswell</a>, Harvard Business Press, 2008<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BoxesAndArrows_Stories/~4/MfxMpQJipcM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></p>"

This version, with extensive wordplay based on the fact that most of a fictional baseball team&#39;s players had &quot;strange nicknames&quot; that seemed to be questions, became known as &quot;Who&#39;s on First?&quot; By 1944, Abbott and Costello had the routine copyrighted.\r\n\r\nAbbott and Costello performed &quot;Who&#39;s on First?&quot; numerous times in their careers, rarely performing it the same way twice. Once, they did the routine at President Roosevelt&#39;s request. The routine was featured in the team&#39;s 1940 film debut, One Night in the Tropics. The duo reprised the bit in their 1945 film The Naughty Nineties, and it is that version which is considered their finest recorded rendition. They also performed the routine numerous times on radio and television (notably in The Abbott and Costello Show episode &quot;The Actor&#39;s Home&quot;).</div>"

This quality, this it, was never named, however, nor was it talked about in any way. As to just what this ineffable quality was…well, it obviously involved bravery. But it was not bravery in the simple sense of being willing to risk your life. The idea seemed to be that any fool could do that…No, the idea here (in the all enclosing fraternity) seemed to be that a man should have the ability to go up in a hurtling piece of machinery and put his hide on the line and then have the moxie, the reflexes, the experience, the coolness, to pull it back in the last yawning moment-and then to go up again the next day, and the next day, and every next day, even if the series should be infinite-and, ultimately, in its best expression, do so in a cause that means something to thousands, to a people, to a nation, to humanity, to God. Nor was there a test to show whether or not a pilot had this righteous quality. There was instead, a seemingly infinite series of tests. A career in flying was like climbing one of those ancient Babylonian  pyramids made up of a dizzy progression of steps and ledges, a ziggurat, a pyramid extraordinarily high and steep; and the idea was to prove at every foot of the way up that pyramid that you were one of the elected and anointed ones who had the right stuff and could move higher and higher and even-ultimately, God willing, one day-that you might be able to join that special few at the very top, that elite who had the capacity to bring tears to men’s eyes, the very Brotherhood of the right stuff indeed.” Tom Wolfe, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312427565?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0312427565\"><em>The Right Stuff</em></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Tom Wolfe believed Chuck Yeager, test pilot extraordinaire and breaker of the sound barrier, to be the “most righteous of all the possessors of the right stuff.”</p>\n<p>But Yeager did not like the phrase himself. To him it implied that a man’s skill in the cockpit was a matter of luck-you were either born with it or you weren’t.</p>\n<p>But Chuck knew better. He hardly discounted the luck factor in a pilot’s career, but he understood, understood better than perhaps any pilot of the time, that the “right stuff” was really attained through hard work, focus, and experience. It was not some ineffable quality that allowed him to rise from buck private to brigadier general, that allowed him to clock 10,000 flying hours in 180 different aircraft,  which helped him break the speed of sound. No, it was his passion and his grit, his all-consuming love for flying and his desire to understand everything about his aircraft “down to the smallest bolt.”</p>\n<p>There are different <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/09/13/the-different-types-of-manliness/\">kinds of manliness. </a>There is the manliness that is quiet and subtle, that you gain an appreciation for slowly, as you spend year after year with a man. And then there is the kind of manliness that hits you upside the head like a 2X4. Which bowls you over from 40 yards away. Chuck Yeager had the latter. His life embodied the various qualities of manliness writ large.</p>\n<p>He lived for risk and excitement and could remain as cool as a cucumber in the face of it. He did not relish killing, but found the speed and strategy of dog-fighting thrilling. He loved the structure of the military and yet from time to time would brazenly break its rules.  His rebellion was rarely of the serious or sullen variety but that of a natural-born prankster who would go to great lengths for a laugh. He was fiercely competitive but never petty. He was not one for navel-gazing, but focused on getting the job done and doing it right.</p>\n<p>He was simply the best at what he did. A flying legend. He was the first Army Air Corps pilot to become an ace in a single mission (shooting down 5 planes in one run), and would go on to become a double ace. He was selected at age 24 to attempt to break the sound barrier, leaving dozens of more senior pilots pilots shocked and jealous. But the selection paid off when he became the first to fly faster than the speed of sound.</p>\n<p>When in-flight refueling was instituted, units of planes struggled to cross the Atlantic without errors and pilots aborting and ditching their planes in the ocean. Yeager was the first to execute a flawless trans-Atlantic deployment of a jet fighter squadron in the history of the Tactical Air Command.</p>\n<p>And he was unsurprisingly the youngest person to be inducted into Aviation Hall of Fame.</p>\n<p>And he did it all with the kind of style and grace under pressure that made it look easy and gave his rivals fits.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img title=\"Chuck Yeager\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2009/12/yeager2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"465\" height=\"469\"></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Chuck Yeager’s Lessons in Manliness</span></h3>\n<blockquote><p>“But, like Dad, I had certain standards I lived by. Whatever I did, I determined to do the best I could at it. I was prideful about keeping my word and finishing what I started. That’s how I was raised. I never got into fights, but no one pushed me around, either.” -Chuck Yeager</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Do Your Best with What You’ve Got</h3>\n<p>Chuck Yeager was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He grew up in a small town in West Virginia as 1 of 5 children. His family lived for a time in a 3 room house in which Chuck and his brother slept in the living room on a pull-out couch. His mom cooked cornmeal mush for breakfast, with the leftovers from that meal being fried up and served for dinner. The idea of Chuck going to college was never even considered.</p>\n<p>Instead, when the boy turned 18, he joined the  US Army Air Corps as an airplane mechanic. When the opportunity came up, he applied to become a “Flying Sargent.” Once he was accepted, he found himself in a position he would remain in his whole career-the odd man out. Almost all the other men were college graduates who would become commissioned officers.</p>\n<p>At first Yeager was intimidated by his well-educated peers, worried he would not be able to keep up. But in the air the men were “all created equal,” and Yeager’s humble background gave him skills that compensated for his lack of a degree and quickly moved him to the head of the pack.</p>\n<p>Everyone agrees that one of the qualities that made Yeager into a legendary pilot was his exceptional eyes. With 20/10 vision,  he could see tiny specks 50 miles away from the cockpit. He saw the enemy coming long before anyone else did.</p>\n<p>He sharpened those eyes as a boy in West Virginia. He knew how to shoot a .22 rifle by the time he was six. He would get up at dawn before school, go out in the woods, kill 3-4 squirrels, and then skin them and leave them in a bucket of water for his mom to cook up for dinner. Calm and steady, he was a real crack shot, and learned to hone in on the smallest things moving in the brush; he once shot a deer at 600 yards.</p>\n<p>From his dad, he picked up a love and aptitude for engineering and mechanical skills. His father was a natural gas driller and would take Chuck out into the field to fix machinery and shoot wells. His father also taught him how to take apart and put back together an engine. This hands-on training gave Yeager a passion for understanding absolutely everything about how planes worked and a leg up on the competition-</p>\n<h3>Know Your Job Inside and Out</h3>\n<p>Being a test pilot was a dangerous and deadly career; little mistakes and oversights left dozens of pilots dead. There was no room for error.</p>\n<p>Test planes were trailed by chase planes that radioed information to the pilot. But Chuck knew radio could stop working and that a situation could arise in which he’d have to make a lightning fast decision; waiting for advice could be deadly.</p>\n<p>So Yeager wanted to know everything he could about every single plane he flew. He pored over the manual, studied the plane’s parts, and asked question after question of the flight engineers. When something went wrong at 800 mph, Yeager knew how to address it and what decision to make. He became one with the machine; he knew his plane like a cowboy knows his horse:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Everything about airplanes interested me: how they flew, what each could or couldn’t do and why. As much as I flew, I was always learning something new, whether it was a switch on the instrument panel I hadn’t noticed, or a handling characteristic of the aircraft in weather conditions I hadn’t experienced. Unlike many pilots, I really wanted to learn the various systems of aircraft…it was a terrific advantage for me when something went wrong at 20,000 feet. Knowing machinery like I did, and having a knowledgeable feel for it, I knew how to cope with practically any problem. I knew what was serious and manageable. All pilots take chances from time to time, but knowing-not guessing-about what you can risk is often the critical difference between getting away with it or drilling a fifty-foot hole in mother earth.” -Chuck Yeager</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img title=\"Chuck Yeager\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2009/12/yeager5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"479\" height=\"302\"></p>\n<h3>Be Smooth</h3>\n<blockquote><p>“What a character. There was just no one else like him.” -Maj. Gen. Fred J. Ascani</p></blockquote>\n<p>Soon after Yeager became a pilot in the Army Air Corps, he was sent to Oroville, CA for training. While stationed there, he sauntered over to the local USO office and struck up a conversation with 18 year old Glennis Dickhouse, the organization’s social director. New in town, Chuck and the other boys were in need of some entertainment, so Yeager asked Glennis to organize a USO dance for the squadron that night. Greatly annoyed with this stranger’s bold request, she asked him, “You expect me to whip up a dance and find thirty girls on three hours notice?” He replied, “No, you’ll only need to come up with twenty-nine, because I want to take you.” Sha-zam!</p>\n<p>Yeager would soon be sent to fight the war overseas. But he named his plane “Glamorous Glennis” and wrote home to that USO gal twice a week. Glennis and Chuck would be hitched for 45 years.</p>\n<h3>Leave No Man Behind</h3>\n<p>After flying 18 missions in the war, Chuck Yeager was shot down over German-occupied France.   Yeager studied the silk map that had been sown into his <a href=\"http://www.schottnyc.com/products/men/bomber/a-2-flight-jacket.htm\">flight jacket</a> and plotted an escape route over the Pyrenees mountains and into Spain.</p>\n<p>Wounded with shrapnel, alone in an area riddled with Germans, Yeager kept a  .45 gripped in his hand and slept under his parachute in the cold and rain until he was picked up by the French Resistance.</p>\n<p>They kept him safe while the snow in the Pyrenees melted (for his part, Yeager helped them make bombs for their covert ops). When it was finally time for him to make his escape over the mountains, he was given maps and supplies and dropped off at night in the middle of nowhere. Together with other downed pilots, Yeager hiked up and over mountains, slogging through snow that was up to his knees. Ambushed along the way, the fellow pilot he was paired with was shot in the knee by a German. Only a tendon was keeping the pilot’s leg on, and Yeager sliced through it and tied off the wound.</p>\n<p>All day and all night, in the dark, in the cold, and in the snow, Yeager dragged the wounded man up an imposing mountain. Part of him wished the man would die, but he didn’t, and Yeager would not leave him behind. Every muscle in his body was burning, and he was nearly delirious with fatigue. But he pushed ever up the mountain with the man in tow. The two pilots made it to a small village in Spain; the legless man lived because of Yeager’s Herculean effort, and Chuck was awarded the Bronze Star.</p>\n<h3>Finish What You Start</h3>\n<p>When Yeager was brought back to Leiston, England, he became the first evadee to make it safely back to Allied lines.</p>\n<p>But the military had a rule that any man who made it back had to be sent back home to the States. They were worried that a returned pilot could be shot down again and tortured by Germans for information about the French underground.</p>\n<p>But Chuck Yeager insisted that he be allowed to finish what he had started. The other men in his unit thought he was out of his mind, but he was determined to stay at the cold, dark base in England. Why? He felt he owed it to the military; he had not yet carried out his duty. He wanted to “make worthwhile all those hard and expensive months of combat training” the Air Corps had invested in him. He made his request to his commanding officer who told him that the rule was unchangeable and that there was nothing that could be done. But Yeager kept appealing his case up the line, all the way up until he spoke with the Supreme Allied Commander himself, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower spoke to the War Department and granted him special permission to stay.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img title=\"Chuck Yeager, NF-104\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2009/12/yeager4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"493\" height=\"387\"></p>\n<h3>Follow Your Passion</h3>\n<blockquote><p>“Yeager was the best. Period. No one matched his skill or courage or, I might add, his capacity to raise hell and have fun.” -Bud Anderson, leading ace of the 363rd Squadron</p></blockquote>\n<p>Chuck Yeager was good at what he did because he loved his job. He lived and breathed flying. His success followed naturally from his passion. In his own words:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If you love the hell out of what you’re doing, you’re usually pretty good at it, and you wind up making your own breaks.”</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>“I never did understand how a pilot could walk by a parked airplane and not want to crawl in the cockpit and fly off. I could not honestly claim to be the best pilot, because as good as you think you are, there is always somebody who is probably better. But I doubt whether there were many who loved to fly as much as I did. Nobody logged more flying time.”</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>“I wasn’t a deep, sophisticated person, but I lived by a basic principle: I did only what I enjoyed. I wouldn’t let anyone derail me by promises of power or money into doing things that weren’t interesting to me. That kept me real and honest. Job titles didn’t mean diddly. Assistant Maintenance Officer might not be a title that would really impress Aunt Maude, but if it meant that I could fly more than anyone else, I’d stick with it for as long as I could.”</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Push on Through</h3>\n<blockquote><p>“He was now involved in what was surely the grimmest and grandest gamble of manhood.” -Tom Wolfe</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some thought the sound barrier was like a brick wall in the sky, and that whoever reached Mach 1 would disintegrate upon “impact.” Other pilots had approached it but backed down from fear. As they closed in on the sound barrier, the plane began to violently shake, and it truly felt as if going any faster would rip the plane to pieces. It was at that point that pilots would get scared and slow it down. But Yeager bit the bullet and pushed on through, finding that once you “broke” the barrier, the shaking stopped and the ride smoothed out. You just had to keep going. How often is life just like that?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img title=\"Chuck Yeager X-1a\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2009/12/yeager6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"350\"></p>\n<h3>Be Tough</h3>\n<p>Two days before he broke the sound barrier, Yeager and his wife were racing horses in the desert at night. Chuck crashed into a gate, got thrown from his horse and broke two of his ribs. Instead of going to the base doctor, who he feared would scratch his upcoming flight, he went to a doctor in a nearby town. The doc told him to refrain from any physical activity for 2 weeks and to keep his right arm immobilized. That was Monday.</p>\n<p>Chuck decided to go forward with the flight scheduled for the next day, telling only his flight engineer, Jack Ridley, about his injury. They decided that handling most of the controls in the X-1 wouldn’t be too bad, but that closing the cockpit door would pose a problem.</p>\n<p>The X-1, or the “Orange Beast” as Chuck called it, did not take off on its own but was instead attached to the bottom of a B-29 and then dropped from the sky like a bomb. When it was time for the drop, Chuck would climb down a ladder at 12,000 feet and get into the cockpit. Once Chuck was inside the Orange Beast, Ridley would come down and close the door behind Yeager, who then had to reach a handle with his right arm to lock the door.</p>\n<p>His broken ribs now made this move impossible. So he and Ridley rigged a broomstick in the handle to allow Yeager to use both arms to close it.</p>\n<p>When Tuesday arrived, Yeager’s right arm felt useless, but he climbed in the cockpit, took off, and pushed the plane so hard he broke the sound barrier.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img title=\"Chuck Yeager\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2009/12/yeager7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"361\"></p>\n<h3>Experience Matters More Than Luck</h3>\n<blockquote><p>“There is no such thing as a natural born pilot. Whatever my aptitudes or talents, becoming a proficient pilot was hard work, really a lifetime’s learning experience. For the best pilots, flying is an obsession, the one thing in life they must do continually. The best pilots fly more than the others; that’s why they’re the best. Experience is everything. The eagerness to learn how and why every piece of equipment works is everything. And luck is everything, too.” -Chuck Yeager</p></blockquote>\n<p>By all counts, Chuck Yeager was a lucky guy. He was born at just the right time to take part in the “golden age of flying” in the 1950s. Yeager bridged two eras-the subsonic and the supersonic. He got to test nearly all the prototypes that would develop into modern aircraft. As Yeager put it, “The old air force was being scrapped, and a new air force was being born right on our doorstep.”</p>\n<p>It was a time before planes became so automated that a pilot could overshoot an airport for an hour without noticing. The pilot was in control of every detail, and was more like a matador than a driver.</p>\n<p>And when that bull was charging at him, it was experience, not luck that saved Yeager’s hide. That experience came particularly in handy while he was testing the X-1A . On this next generation of the X-1, the  canopy was bolted into place; there was no door and no ejection seat. If there was a fire or a malfunction, the pilot was trapped inside.</p>\n<p>While out on a test run, when Yeager hit a new speed record-2.4 Mach- the plane went haywire, ferociously rolling, pitching, and spinning towards the earth like a frisbee. The plane fell 51,000 feet in 51 seconds. Yeager was thrown around like rag doll in the cockpit, and his helmeted head cracked the canopy. His pressure suit inflated, the face plate of his  helmet fogged over, and Yeager felt like he was a goner. But with less than a minute before impact, Yeager flipped the X-1A into a normal spin, evened  it out, and landed battered but alive. Yeager said of the experience:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“To survive took everything I knew and had ever experienced in a cockpit, so that maybe one hour less flying time could have been the difference between drilling a hole or landing safely. I saved myself from sheer instinct based on hundreds of previous spin-tests. Experienced at spinning down to earth, I was less disoriented than others who had done it many fewer times, and was more likely to make the right moves to save myself.”</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img title=\"Chuck Yeager\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2009/12/yeager11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"279\" height=\"400\">At 86 years old, Chuck Yeager is still going strong, hunting, fishing, giving speeches and of course, flying. He doesn’t believe in slowing down in retirement. At age 62, he had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“You do what you can for as long as you can, and when you finally can’t, you do the next best thing. You back up but you don’t give up…I know too many people who have erected barriers, real brick walls, just because they have gray hair, and prematurely cut off themselves from lifelong enjoyments by thinking, ‘I’m too old to do this or that-that’s for younger people.’ Living to a ripe old age is not an end in itself; the trick is to enjoy the years remaining. And unlike flying, learning how to take pleasure from living can’t be taught. Unfortunately, many people do not consider fun an important item on their daily agenda. For me, that was always high priority in whatever I was doing…</p>\n<p>I’m definitely not a rocking-chair type. I can’t sit around, watch television, get fat, and fade out. And there’s so much more I want to do; I’ve never lost my curiosity about things that interest me…I haven’t yet done everything, but by the time I’m finished, I won’t have missed much. If I auger in tomorrow, it won’t be with a frown on my face. I’ve had a ball.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553256742?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0553256742\"><em>The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe</em></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553256742?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0553256742\"><em>Chuck Yeager: an Autobiography</em></a></p>\n                                        Download<a href=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com.s3.amazonaws.com/man_cook_book.pdf\">The Art of Manliness Free Man Cookbook</a><br>\nDownload<a href=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com.s3.amazonaws.com/free_ebook.PDF\">The Art of Manliness Guide to Being a Gentleman</a><br>\n<br>\n<b>Hawaiiabera Discount Code: AOM</b><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n                                                                                                                                                    Check Out These Related Posts:<ul><li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/12/03/so-you-want-my-job-air-force-pilot/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"December 3, 2008\">So You Want My Job: Air Force Pilot</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/10/15/so-you-want-my-job-road-test-driver/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"October 15, 2009\">So You Want My Job: Road Test Driver</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/11/04/lessons-in-manliness-jimmy-stewart/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"November 4, 2009\">Lessons in Manliness: Jimmy Stewart</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/04/30/7-lessons-in-manliness-from-the-greatest-generation/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"April 30, 2009\">7 Lessons in Manliness From the Greatest Generation</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/10/09/morse-code/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"October 9, 2008\">Become a Morse Code Expert</a></li>\n</ul><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/f3iv4dtffn7nla1icg3h2et32g/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fartofmanliness.com%2F2010%2F01%2F15%2Flessons-in-manliness-chuck-yeager%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?a=oyMHj2LvF9k:7ZhOwJNXIZI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?a=oyMHj2LvF9k:7ZhOwJNXIZI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?i=oyMHj2LvF9k:7ZhOwJNXIZI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?a=oyMHj2LvF9k:7ZhOwJNXIZI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?i=oyMHj2LvF9k:7ZhOwJNXIZI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?a=oyMHj2LvF9k:7ZhOwJNXIZI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?i=oyMHj2LvF9k:7ZhOwJNXIZI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?a=oyMHj2LvF9k:7ZhOwJNXIZI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?i=oyMHj2LvF9k:7ZhOwJNXIZI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?a=oyMHj2LvF9k:7ZhOwJNXIZI:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheArtOfManliness?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/oyMHj2LvF9k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

I work on a project just long enough to forget what I did to fix that error. I’m going to document it here. </p>\n<p>The reason this is happening is because the user instance that I’m running IIS under does not have the proper credentials. You can fix this by creating a new app pool in IIS, and having it run under a user that has the rights to create a db (most likely your own account). What I do is create an AppPool called “PrivilegedAppPool” and have it run under my own account. Then restart IIS and you should be able to create your db on the fly. </p>\n<p>Presto.

On December 20, Apple announced that it would spend $400 million to purchase Steve Jobs’s company, Next Software. The company said it would adopt Next’s NextStep operating system for future versions of the Macintosh computer.

In fact, it’s more extreme than that — it’s both amazingly good and horribly bad. And, frustratingly, many of us see how the bad parts could be made better without sacrificing the good parts.</p>\n\n<p>This piece by Paul Graham addresses this dichotomy, and tries to make sense of Apple’s seeming blindness to the App Store’s severe problems:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Actually I suppose Apple has a third misconception: that all the\n  complaints about App Store approvals are not a serious problem.\n  They must hear developers complaining. But partners and suppliers\n  are always complaining. It would be a bad sign if they weren’t;\n  it would mean you were being too easy on them. Meanwhile the\n  iPhone is selling better than ever. So why do they need to fix\n  anything?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later on, Graham captures what it is that gives me The Fear:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An organization that wins by exercising power\n  starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wish I’d written that sentence.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Paul Graham on How the App Store Has Damaged Apple’s Reputation With Developers’\" href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/11/19/graham-app-store\"> ★ </a>\n</div>"

Plus, if there are any fascinating revelations that I really should hear about I’ll undoubtedly discover them (in a much-condensed form) in many other places rehashing his content.</p>\n<p>This <a title=\"Author Malcolm Gladwell on New Book &#39;What the Dog Saw&#39; - TIME\" href=\"http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1931100,00.html\"><strong><em>interview with Malcolm Gladwell—where he discusses education, hiring and journalism</em></strong></a>—is typically Gladwellian <em>and</em> worth your time, however.</p>\n<p>On education:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If I were [the United States Secretary of Education], I’d think of myself as a venture capitalist, fund as many wacky and inventive ideas as I could, and closely monitor them to see how they worked.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been fascinated by the idea that in inner-city schools, the thing they do best is sports. […] It’s not correct to say these schools are dysfunctional; they’re highly functional in certain areas. So I’ve always wondered about using the principles of sports in the classroom. Go same sex; do everything in teams; have teams compete with each other.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On teaching and hiring practises:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Certain kinds of predictions are impossible. If you want to find out if someone can do the job, you have to let them do the job. We should be experimenting with people too. I feel very strongly about the notion that if you want to find the best teachers, you let everybody into the profession, monitor them for two years, and then pick the 10% that are the best. That’s how you do it, and that’s completely the opposite of the way we do it now. Right now we’re acting out a fiction, which is that we can tell whether someone’s good at this enormously complex thing called teaching before they’ve ever taught.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And the single piece of advice he would offer to young journalists?</p>\n<blockquote><p>The issue is not writing. It’s what you write about. […] Aspiring journalists should stop going to journalism programs and go to some other kind of grad school. If I was studying today, I would go get a master’s in statistics, and maybe do a bunch of accounting courses and then write from that perspective. I think that’s the way to survive. The role of the generalist is diminishing. Journalism has to get smarter.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I particularly like that penultimate sentence: <em>The role of the generalist is diminishing</em>.

Amendment rights by legally but brazenly brandishing unconcealed firearms in public.</p>\n<p>I will foreswear the time-honored principles of fairness, decency, and respect by screaming unintelligible platitudes regarding tyranny, Nazi-ism, and socialism at public town halls.  Also.</p>\n<p>I pledge to eliminate all government intervention in my life.  I will abstain from the use of and participation in any socialist goods and services including but not limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social Security</li>\n<li>Medicare/Medicaid</li>\n<li>State Children’s Health Insurance

them)</li>\n<li>Socialist Byproducts of Government Investment Such as Duct Tape and Velcro (Nazi-NASA Inventions)</li>\n<li>Use of the Internets, email, and networked computers, as the DoD’s ARPANET

Subsidies</li>\n<li>Clothing Made from Crops (e.g. cotton) That Were Grown With or That Contain Inputs From Government Subsidies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a veteran of the government-run socialist US

oppose and condemn the government-funded and therefore socialist military of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>I will boycott the products of socialist defense contractors such as GE, Lockheed-Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Raytheon, Humana, FedEx, General Motors, Honeywell, and hundreds of others that are paid by our socialist government to produce goods for our socialist army.</p>\n<p>I will protest socialist security departments such as the Pentagon, FBI, CIA, Department of Homeland Security, TSA, Department of Justice and their socialist employees.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching eligible retirement age, I will tear up my socialist Social Security checks.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching age 65, I will forego Medicare and pay for my own private health

It’s fattening and gets sticky when it gets hot. And, yes, you never know what you’re going to get — from day to day, hour to hour, especially when you’re press — covering the endless events, news conferences, panels and merchandisers.</p>\n<p>Now that the insanity is more than 24 hours in the rear-view mirror, this reporter is filing his last bit of <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/07/only-at-comic-con-bike-cabbies-fend-off-alien-invasion/\">local color from the convention</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"float:left;padding-right:10px\"><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/underwire/\"><img src=\"http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/underwire/2009/07/bug_comiccon.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>\n<p>Wired.com will feature an exclusive interview with Anthony Daniels (C-3PO, right) Tuesday in which he’ll discuss his career giving voice to that iconic gold faceplate and his hosting gig on the new <a href=\"http://starwarsinconcert.com/\"><em>Star Wars</em>: in Concert</a> tour.</p>\n<p>Daniels is a soft-spoken gentleman who carefully considers his answers, so the interview took a little longer than expected. But, as it wrapped up, Daniels mentioned the power that John Williams’ classic scores still have on people of all ages.</p>\n<p>This reporter agreed and mentioned that my 5-year-old Godson (Tyler) listens to <em>Star Wars</em> soundtrack CDs every night before he goes to sleep.</p>\n<p>Since Daniels was so generous with his time, I went for broke and shattered an unwritten law of journalism. I asked the celebrity for a personal favor. Would he record a “hello” to Tyler in character? After all, the kid is still at that magical age where <em>Star Wars</em> characters really exist.</p>\n<p>Daniels’ response caught me off-guard.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>“Can you call him?” It’s hard not to describe Daniels’ expression as “impish.”</p>\n<p>Yes, I could call Tyler. And when C-3PO tells you do something, you do it.</p>\n<p>So, between Press Room 28D in the San Diego Convention Center and South 77th Street in Milwaukee, Tyler had a phone chat with C-3PO, Human/Cyborg Relations. You won’t find too many speechless 5-year-olds in the world, but I’m told Tyler was happily silent and in awe after he hung up with “a galaxy far, far away.”</p>\n<p>So, amidst all the complaints that the convention is too big, too crowded, too noisy, too stinky, too commercial, too Hollywood, etc., it takes something like this to remind us that Comic-Con exists to honor everything that can leave a kid wide-eyed with wonder — no matter the age of the kid.</p>\n<p><em>Image courtesy 20th Century Fox</em></p>\n<p><strong>See also:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/underwire/2008/07/c-3po-flash-dri/\">C-3PO Flash Drive Takes Its Bow at Comic-Con</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/11/geekdad-holid-3/\">GeekDad Holiday Gift Guide #4: GeekMoms!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/underwire/2008/06/star-voices-ret/\">Star Voices Return for <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/02/is-pottery-barn/\">Pottery Barn Kids Print Borrows from a 1977 Burger King <em>Star Wars</em></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/48rbogjngtu4qn9uatsr2rislo/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Funderwire%2F2009%2F07%2Fsaying-farewell-to-sdcc-2009-with-cons-finest-memory%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.wired.com/~ff/wiredunderwire?a=DggSC7-c4yU:UOSt3V2Ye8A:cGdyc7Q-1BI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wiredunderwire?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wired.com/~ff/wiredunderwire?a=DggSC7-c4yU:UOSt3V2Ye8A:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wiredunderwire?i=DggSC7-c4yU:UOSt3V2Ye8A:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wired.com/~ff/wiredunderwire?a=DggSC7-c4yU:UOSt3V2Ye8A:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wiredunderwire?i=DggSC7-c4yU:UOSt3V2Ye8A:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wired.com/~ff/wiredunderwire?a=DggSC7-c4yU:UOSt3V2Ye8A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wiredunderwire?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wiredunderwire/~4/DggSC7-c4yU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<p>Everyone wants to know how my month offline was. They ask it casually, like “How’s work going?” or “What’d you do this weekend?” But it’s not a casual question. It was a huge, incredible, transformative experience. Those 30 days felt like six months. My habits changed, my relationships changed, my identity changed, my personality changed — hell, the physical shape of my body changed dramatically. I went through four legal pads trying to describe what it was like. I’m still not sure I really know.</p>\n\n<p>One thing is clear, though: my normal life style isn’t healthy. This doesn’t seem like the kind of thing that requires a break to learn. I imagine people with unhealthy lifestyles <em>know</em> they’re unhealthy. They come home after work and say “I can’t go on like this,” they cry randomly in elevators. But I didn’t know. Life online is practically the only life I know. Sure, I guess things were different when I was very young — I remember, after getting my first email account, wishing someone would email me so I’d have an email to answer (even then I knew I’d soon be missing those empty-inbox days) — but for most of my life, this has been it: a jumble of interruptions and requests and jobs and people, largely carried out alone. It never let up, so I never saw anything different. How was I to know there was anything wrong?</p>\n\n<p>But the last few weeks have made it clear there was — is. These weeks haven’t felt that different my other weeks online, really — same jumble of work and people and interruptions as always. The usual sense that I’m never really <em>here</em>, I’m always worried about the million things around the corner: a todo list that goes for pages, a thousand emails to respond to, hundreds of blog posts to read, twenty open tabs, a dozen IM windows, a text message to answer, a Twitter stream to catch up on. I never used to think about these things as a benefit <em>or</em> a distraction — I didn’t think about them at all; they were just how life online was. This was the era of multitasking and I was its child. If I felt anything about it, it was pride — a kind of joy in (mostly) managing to handle a thousand different things thrown my way at once. But I never knew what life was like when things <em>weren’t</em> constantly being thrown at you. Until it stopped, I never knew how awful it really was.</p>\n\n<p>I am not happy. I used to think of myself as just an unhappy person: a misanthrope, prone to mood swings and eating binges, who spends his days moping around the house in his pajamas, too shy and sad to step outside. But that’s not how I was offline. I loved people — everyone from the counter clerk to the old friends I bumped into on the street. And I loved to go for walks and exercise in the gym and — even though there was no one around to see me — groom. Yes, groom: shower and shave and put on nice clothes and comb my hair and clean up my nails and so on, all things a month ago I would have said went against my very nature, things I never did before <em>voluntarily</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But most of all, I felt not just happy, but firmly happy — solid, is the best way I can put it. I felt like I was in control of my life instead of the other way around, like its challenges just bounced off me as I kept doing what I wanted. Normally I feel buffeted by events, a thousand tiny distractions nagging at the back of my head at all times. Offline, I felt in control of my own destiny. I felt, yes, serene.</p>\n\n<p>When I was very young, my parents introduced me to a book called <em><a href=\"http://books.theinfo.org/go/0061339202\">Flow</a></em>. It argued that people good at their jobs went into a sort of flow state — they were “in the zone” — where the normal stress of the world faded away and all their concentration was focused on the task at hand. It wasn’t “fun” the way ice cream or sex is fun — it didn’t make you smile, just look grimly determined — but it was somehow more than that. It was <em>fulfilling</em>. And that was even better than a smile.</p>\n\n<p>I go into such states when programming or writing and they are indeed fantastic, but also weirdly hollow. When you come out the real world — with its mundane stresses and distractions — comes crashing back in, and the moment of flow seems like just another temporary escape, an elusive dream. And it’s a hard one to get back.</p>\n\n<p>I still had flow states while offline — stronger than ever, in fact: I spent an ecstatic afternoon and evening writing longhand in a trance, pouring out the first forty pages of the book I’ve been researching; afterward, I was on a bigger high than I’ve ever had in my life — but they didn’t feel like escapes. Normal days weren’t painful anymore. I didn’t spend them filled with worry, like before. Offline, I felt solid and composed. Online, I feel like my brain wants to run off in a million different directions, even when I try to point it forward.</p>\n\n<p>A friend asked me if I knew I was privileged to be able to take such a break. It seemed a silly question: I feel privileged every day. As I write, my best friend is broke and homeless, much of the world struggles just to stay alive. I feel privileged to own a mattress, let alone take a break.</p>\n\n<p>I realize everyone’s lives are filled with work and people and distractions — the situation brewing at the office, the sump pump breaking down at the house, the family member who’s fallen ill. I realize it must seem like the greatest arrogance to think one could escape life’s mundane concerns, like asking to live on a cloud, floating above the mere mortals. But it was that arrogance that made me think I could contribute to adult mailing lists when I was still in elementary school, that arrogance that made me think someone might want to read my website when I was still just a teen, that arrogance that had me start a company as a college freshman. That sort of arrogance — not bragging, but simply inwardly thinking I could do more than was expected of me — is the only thing that’s gotten me anywhere in life. I see no reason to stop now.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know how I’m going to carve a life away from the world’s constant demands and distractions. I don’t know how I’m going to balance all the things I want to do with the pressures and responsibilities they bring. But after my month off, I do know one thing: I can’t go on like this. So I’m damn well going to try.</p>"

In this entry, I've collected some of the best resources on the web related to the anniversary...articles, historical documents, audio, video, transcripts, photos, and the like. Enjoy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://wechoosethemoon.org/\">We Choose the Moon</a> is tracking the activities of the Apollo 11 mission as it happened 40 years ago. Very nicely done.</p>\n\n<p>Housed on NASA's history site is <a href=\"http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.html\">a ton of resources about the Apollo 11 landing</a>, including <a href=\"http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html\">an annotated transript of the landing</a>, which makes for really interesting reading. MP3 files are also available as are <a href=\"http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/video11.html\">many, many video clips of the landing at the astronauts' time on the surface</a>. Highlights: <a href=\"http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11Landing.mov\">this video</a> was shot out of the window of the lunar module from a height of 50,000 feet until one minute after touchdown and I've never seen Armstrong's first step on the Moon <a href=\"http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1092206.mov\">from this angle before</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For its July 21, 1969 issue, The NY Times used 96 pt. type to declare that <a href=\"http://kottke.org/08/11/obama-is-big-news-at-the-ny-times\">MEN WALK ON MOON</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The landing was made four miles west of the aiming point, but well within the designated area. An apparent error in some data fed into the craft's guidance computer from the earth was said to have accounted for the discrepancy.</p><p>Suddenly the astronauts were startled to see that the computer was guiding them toward a possibly disastrous touchdown in a boulder-filled crater about the size of a football field.</p><p>Mr. Armstrong grabbed manual control of the vehicle and guided it safely over the crater to a smoother spot, the rocket engine stirring a cloud of moon dust during the final seconds of descent.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/apollo-11-01.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"371\" alt=\"Apollo 11\"></p>\n\n<p>The Onion used larger type and <a href=\"http://members.shaw.ca/rlongpre01/moon.html\">took a more unadulterated and profane approach</a> (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIkHLO93lCA\">love the video version</a>).</p>\n\n<p>John Noble Wilford, the Times journalist who wrote the front page story underneath the 96 pt. type -- \"the biggest single story of my career\" -- recounts his Apollo 11 experience and ponders the Apollo program's legacy <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/14/science/space/14mission.html?pagewanted=all\">in a great piece for the Times</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>It then occurs to me that if Columbus and Capt. James Cook were alive, they might be less astonished by two men landing on the Moon than by the millions of people, worldwide, watching every step of the walk as it happens. Exploring is old, but instantaneous telecommunications is new and marvelous.</p><p>In just 1.3 seconds, the time it takes for radio waves to travel the 238,000 miles from Moon to Earth, each step by Armstrong and Aldrin is seen, and their voices heard, throughout the world they have for the time being left behind. In contrast to exploration's previous landfalls, the whole world shares in this moment.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/apollo-11-02.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"386\" alt=\"Apollo 11\"></p>\n\n<p>The Apollo 11 mission in photographs: NASA Images is the comprehensive source for <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/view/search/what/Apollo+11/?q=Apollo\">NASA photos of the Apollo 11 mission</a>; the always excellent Big Picture <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/07/remembering_apollo_11.html\">has photos of the mission from a variety of sources</a>; David Burnett shot <a href=\"http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/13/showcase-19/\">photos of people watching the launch</a>; Time looks at Apollo astronauts <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1910784,00.html\">Now and Then</a>; the NY Times collected <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/07/15/science/space/20090715moon-readers_index.html\">photos from readers of their Apollo 11 moments</a>; Life has several photo galleries: <a href=\"http://www.life.com/image/50702234/in-gallery/24431/buzz-aldrin-talks-to-life\">Buzz Aldrin Looks Back</a>, <a href=\"http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/23232/apollo-11-scenes-from-the-moon\">Scenes From the Moon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/29522/exclusive-up-close-with-apollo-11\">Up Close With Apollo 11</a> (rare and never-published photos), and <a href=\"http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/29132/apollo-11-the-world-watches\">The World Watches</a>; and <a href=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=apollo+11&amp;q=source%3Alife\">Google's archive of Life magazine's Apollo 11 images</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11_lpi_trvrsmap.gif\">A map of where Armstrong and Aldrin walked</a> during their 2+ hours on the surface.

Our next generation must think boldly in terms of a goal for the space program: Mars for America's future. I am not suggesting a few visits to plant flags and do photo ops but a journey to make the first homestead in space: an American colony on a new world.</p><p>Robotic exploration of Mars has yielded tantalizing clues about what was once a water-soaked planet. Deep beneath the soils of Mars may lie trapped frozen water, possibly with traces of still-extant primitive life forms. Climate change on a vast scale has reshaped Mars. With Earth in the throes of its own climate evolution, human outposts on Mars could be a virtual laboratory to study these vast planetary changes. And the best way to study Mars is with the two hands, eyes and ears of a geologist, first at a moon orbiting Mars and then on the Red Planet's surface.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouRbkBAOGEw&amp;fmt=18\">Video of John F. Kennedy's \"we choose to go to the Moon\" speech</a> given at Rice University on September 12, 1962. Fewer than 7 years later, Apollo 11 achieved the goal that Kennedy laid out in that speech.</p>\n\n<p>In a piece for New Scientist, <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327162.500-apollo-special-the-loneliest-museum.html?full=true\">Linda Geddes writes about possible future lunar parks</a> and how they might be preserved.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Around these [landing sites] are scattered smaller artefacts and personal items, such as Neil Armstrong's boots and portable life-support system, scientific instruments and their power generators -- and, of course, the iconic US flag which remains planted in the moon's surface. Then there are the footprints and rover tread paths. Despite the passing of the years, these remain carved into the dust because the moon has no wind or rain to wash them away.</p><p>Anthropologist P. J. Capelotti of Penn State University in Abington has mapped out five \"lunar parks\". These cover the areas where the majority of the artefacts are concentrated and could be used as a basis for future preservation efforts. \"Nobody's saying that the whole moon has to be off limits, but as people are starting to make plans for tourism and mineral extraction, or for putting a base there, they just need to be aware of them and work around them.\"</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Since returning from the Moon, Neil Armstrong has been less and less willing to speak in public about his Apollo 11 experience. For the 40th anniversary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/jul/15/neil-armstrong-nasa-apollo-event\">Armstrong will not take part in the NASA event to commemorate the landing</a>. His only appearance related to the anniversary will be a 15-minute lecture at a Smithsonian Institution event on Sunday night. I found <a href=\"http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/eventDetail.cfm?eventID=1378\">this event</a> on the National Air and Space Museum site...maybe that's it? If so, then Armstrong's lecture will be webcast live on the NASA TV site that evening.</p>\n\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/RMINSD7MmT4%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26hd%3D1&amp;width=500&amp;height=401\" width=\"500\" height=\"401\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Popular Science shares <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-amp-space/article/2009-06/40-years-later-ten-things-you-didnt-know-about-apollo-ii-moon-landing\">a list of ten things you didn't know about the Apollo 11 Moon landing</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>7. When Buzz Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface, he had to make sure not to lock the Eagle's door because there was no outer handle.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.moonwalkone.com/\">Moonwalk One</a> is a documentary film about Apollo released in 1970 to little fanfare, even though it won an award at the Cannes Film Festival. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonwalk_One\">The film</a> was commissioned by NASA but with so much Apollo activity and information happening in the late 60s and early 70s, no one was interested in distributing or seeing the film and it was soon forgotten. Recently, the only remaining 35mm print of the film was located under the director's desk, restored, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002BFLMVS/ref=nosim/0sil8\">offered for sale on DVD</a> in time for the 40th anniversary.</p>\n\n<p>To get a feel of what it was like in the Soviet Union during the Apollo 11 mission, <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=apollo-moon-khrushchev\">Scientific American interviewed Sergei Khrushchev</a>, son of former Russian premier Nikita Khrushchev. The reaction was somewhat more subdued than in other parts of the world.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Of course, you cannot have people land on the moon and just say nothing. It was published in all the newspapers. But if you remember [back then] when Americans spoke of the first man in space, they were always talking of \"the first American in space\" [not Yuri Gagarin]. The same feeling was prevalent in Russia. There were small articles when Apollo 11 was launched. Actually, there was a small article on the first page of Pravda and then three columns on page five. I looked it up again.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Eat Me Daily <a href=\"http://www.eatmedaily.com/2009/07/food-of-the-apollo-11-lunar-landing/\">explores the food consumed on the mission</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The Apollo crew even dined on thermo-stabilized cheddar cheese spread and hot dogs during the moon mission, bringing at least a bit of America in July to the sterile flight craft. And yes, there was bacon - foreshadowing the current bacon craze, the first meal eaten by man on the moon was none other than bacon cubes, coated with gelatin to combat crumbs.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/apollo-11-04.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"348\" alt=\"Apollo 11\"></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1969-07-26\">The issue of the New Yorker published just after the Moon landing</a> is worth a look: <a href=\"http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1969-07-26#folio=024\">much of the Talk of the Town section</a> is devoted to the landing and there's also <a href=\"http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1969-07-26#folio=084\">a Letter from the Space Center</a>. (Subscribers only.)</p>\n\n<p>The main NASA site has <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/apollo11_landing/index.html\">an interactive feature to explore the landing site and Eagle</a> (Eagle was the name of the lunar module).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there's still some good stuff to be had on the old telly on Monday. The History Channel has <a href=\"http://www.history.com/shows.do?action=detail&amp;episodeId=469922\">As It Happened: Man on the Moon</a> at 8pm ET:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This special takes viewers back to July 1969 to experience the actual CBS News/Walter Cronkite coverage of man's first lunar landing. Using minimal editing and leaving the original footage untouched viewers will feel as if they are watching the CBS coverage in July of 1969. While today we know the outcome of Apollo 11's mission it was not a given then. This will become evident watching Walter Cronkite and his colleagues as they watch the historic lunar mission unfold before them.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>and <a href=\"http://www.history.com/genericContent.do?id=71504\">Moonshot</a>, a two-hour documentary about Apollo 11, at 9pm ET. Turner Classic Movies is airing a bunch of Moon-related movies all day, including <a href=\"http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=29935&amp;mainArticleId=241098\">A Trip to the Moon</a> (a 12-minute film from 1902) at 8pm ET and the excellent <a href=\"http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=241247&amp;mainArticleId=241098\">For All Mankind</a> (newly out <a href=\"http://www.criterion.com/films/599\">on Criterion Blu-ray</a>) at 8:15pm ET. <a href=\"http://dsc.discovery.com/\">The Discovery Channel</a> has When We Left the Earth, a one-hour documentary on the mission, at 10pm ET.

But then, on the morning after, congressmen began to wonder about something that hadn't dawned on them since Kennedy's oration. What was this single combat stuff -- they didn't use the actual term -- really all about? It had been a battle for morale at home and image abroad. Fine, O.K., we won, but it had no tactical military meaning whatsoever. And it had cost a fortune, $150 billion or so. And this business of sending a man to Mars and whatnot? Just more of the same, when you got right down to it. How laudable ... how far-seeing ... but why don't we just do a Scarlett O'Hara and think about it tomorrow?</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/julymoon/\">July Moon</a> is a forthcoming documentary about some lost NASA tapes.

The tags are wireless monitors, which report the location of each piece of garbage to a central server. This way, the public will be able to view each piece of garbage on a visual map in real time.</p>\n<p>“When you have paper in your hand and you throw it away, you lose the connection because that doesn’t belong to you,” explained Musstanser Tinauli, a research assistant at MIT Senseable City lab, in a phone interview with Wired.com. “But our tags make this invisible connection between the people and their trash because it keeps sending the message that it’s still alive. We do see there’s going to be a very strong behavioral impact.”</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, the Trash Track team began deploying tagged trash throughout Seattle. When the project concludes, a group of end-of-cycle experts will analyze the environmental impact of each type of waste based on the distance it traveled and the amount of carbon dioxide emitted, according to Tinauli.</p>\n<p>Trash Track’s tracking map will be available soon at <a href=\"http://www.trashtrack.info/\">MIT’s Trash Blog</a>.
